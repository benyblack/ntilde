    /// <c>HeadlessUnitTestSession</c> dispatcher worker that actually runs those tests is

    /// <strong>This was written as the fix for #81 and is not one.</strong> The claim it
    /// carried — that the parallel blockers starved the dispatcher worker out of the pool
    /// and that starvation was the testhost hang — did not survive the dumps. All four
    /// specimens showed idle workers, one of them seventeen, so the dispatcher worker was
    /// schedulable in every hang that was ever captured. The actual cause is a throw out of
    /// <c>EnsureIsolatedApplication()</c>, which sits outside the try in
    /// <c>HeadlessUnitTestSession.DispatchCore</c> and so unwinds the assembly's one
    /// dispatcher loop; <c>TerminalPane.InitializeCommandAssist</c> carries the full account
    /// and PR #416 the fix.
    /// <para>
    /// Kept because giving a pool headroom is defensible for this host on its own terms —
    /// the blocking described above is real whatever it did or did not cause — and because
    /// removing it would be a change to the lane's scheduling made on no evidence, which is
    /// how it came to be here in the first place. What is removed is the causal claim.
