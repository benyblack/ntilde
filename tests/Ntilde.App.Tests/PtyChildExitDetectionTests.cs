    /// therefore never learned that a shell was gone: it only learned that a host had
    /// *crashed*. That is why the pane in #311's bug report sat there looking alive, and why
    /// #311's banner never appeared in a real build even with every headless test passing —
    /// those tests raise the exit event directly, so they cover everything downstream of it
    /// and nothing upstream.

    /// These tests drive real shells and assert on the event itself, which is the piece that
