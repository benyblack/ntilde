///
/// Audited against current <c>main</c>, the specific claims no longer hold — #154's
/// <c>DetachFromUiThread</c> split and the cached-delegate pairs in session setup closed them. But
/// "no longer holds" is only as good as the next edit, and the reasoning is non-obvious, so these
/// tests pin the properties the safety actually rests on:
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>The one subscription the pane makes on an app-lifetime singleton is removed on dispose, so
/// opening and closing tabs does not pile handlers onto a global.</item>
/// <item>Re-running session setup does not add a second copy of the handlers it puts on the pane's
/// own long-lived <c>TermView</c> — the thing <c>Reconnect()</c> would otherwise do on every
/// reconnect.</item>
/// <item>A disposed pane has no <c>TermView</c> handlers left at all.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Everything else <c>InitializeSession</c> subscribes targets an object recreated with the session
/// — a fresh <c>AnsiParser</c>, the new <c>ITerminalSession</c> — so those lists start empty by
/// construction. That is the load-bearing assumption behind leaving 9 parser handlers unsubscribed,
/// and it is pinned separately in <c>PaneReconnectTests</c> because it needs a real shell.
