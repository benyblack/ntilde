    ///   * ProcessLoop calls it after its try/catch, so a throwing subscriber escaped the thread
    ///     entirely — an unhandled exception on a dedicated thread, which tears down the process
    ///     rather than the session.
    ///   * ReadLoop calls it from its `finally` on the read-failure path, *before* the teardown
    ///     that cancels the token and completes the output queue. A throw there escaped the whole
    ///     try statement and took the teardown with it, so the session was left half-alive with
    ///     ProcessLoop parked on a queue nobody would ever complete.
    ///
    /// Both are reachable from the public API by one badly behaved event handler.
