/// Redirects <c>NTILDE_APPDATA_ROOT</c> to a fresh, empty directory for as long as the scope

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Both halves of that matter, and the write half is the one that surprised us. A
/// <c>MainWindow</c>'s <c>OnClosing</c> runs <c>PerformAppTeardown</c>, which calls
/// <c>SessionManager.SaveSession</c> — so every test that closes a window persists a session to
/// whatever root is current. Against the real root that means two things: it overwrites the
/// developer's own saved session when they run the suite locally, and it leaves a file behind that
/// steers the *startup path* of every window built later in the process.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That second effect is not theoretical; it is #434. <c>TestMainWindowFactory.Create()</c> calls
/// <c>AddTab</c> and registers a pane synchronously when no session exists, but takes
/// <c>TryRestoreStartupSession</c> when one does — and there only the selected tab is built
/// eagerly, the rest being placeholders that hold no pane until a Background-priority post runs.
/// <c>CaptureSession</c> persists every tab unconditionally with <c>Root = BuildPaneTree(...)</c>,
/// and that is null for a tab whose content is not a pane tree, so a saved session can select a
/// tab that restores to nothing. A window built from it registers no pane at all, which is what
/// reddened the gate on main - twice from one commit, on both OS lanes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Setting the variable is not by itself enough to make the root empty.
/// <see cref="AppPaths.EnsureInitialized"/> migrates a legacy roaming <c>last_session.json</c> to
/// whatever <c>SessionFilePath</c> resolves to when it runs, once per process behind an
/// <c>_initialized</c> flag — so a scope that happens to be what first touches
/// <see cref="AppPaths"/> would have that session copied *into* the directory that is supposed to
/// have none. Forcing the initialization here pins it to a known point and lets the sweep below
/// undo it; the call is a no-op once anything else in the process has run it.
