/// <summary>
/// Covers <see cref="RustPtySession.ResolveSystemTool"/>, which turns a helper name such as
/// <c>pgrep</c> into an absolute path without handing the lookup to the operating system's
/// implicit <c>PATH</c> search (csharpsquid:S4036).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The rule is satisfied by any absolute path, so the first attempt at it hard-coded
/// <c>/usr/bin</c> with a <c>/bin</c> fallback. That is a list of the layouts we happened to think
/// of, and it is wrong on every prefix-based distribution: under Nix, Guix or a custom prefix
/// <c>pgrep</c> is on <c>PATH</c> and in neither directory, so the probe launched a path that does
/// not exist, swallowed the failure, and reported that the shell had no children.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That false negative is not cosmetic. <c>HasActiveChildProcesses</c> feeds
/// <c>ShouldAutoAcceptRunningPaneClose</c>, so a pane with a running child would close without the
/// confirmation prompt that exists to protect it. Hence the order pinned here: trusted system
/// directories first, so the answer does not depend on the environment where it does not have to,
/// and <c>PATH</c> only as the fallback that keeps those layouts working.
