/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The clamp it replaced - <c>Math.Max(cols, 1)</c>, <c>Math.Max(rows, 1)</c> - turned a control
/// with no size into a 1x1 terminal, and a 1x1 resize is destructive rather than merely useless.
/// At one column the buffer re-wraps the whole transcript to one character per row, which blows the
/// scrollback budget; the eviction that follows is permanent, so growing back cannot undo it.
/// Measured on <c>TerminalBuffer</c> directly, a plain resize against a 1x1 round trip: of 2000
/// lines, 2000 survive the first and 80 the second; of 200, all 200 against 72.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Zero size is ordinary. A control that has not been laid out, one inside a collapsed or hidden
/// container, and one detached from the visual tree all measure zero, and every one of those used
/// to be reported to the buffer - and forwarded to the PTY - as a one-by-one terminal.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Tested through the seam rather than by driving layout, because what needs pinning is the
/// decision itself: which sizes are refused, and that the accepted ones are unchanged.
