/// without a UI test. This file also has to stay cheap in that specific way: adding an Avalonia
/// test class shifts what runs next to what, and this repo has a history of that destabilising
/// <c>VerticalTabStripTests</c> and <c>TabRunningCommandTests</c> (see the remarks in
/// <c>TestWindowTeardownTests</c>), which are among the classes the scope is being added to.
