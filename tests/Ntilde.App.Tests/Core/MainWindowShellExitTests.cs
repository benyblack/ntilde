/// <summary>
/// #311. The targeting test is the important one: a shell dying in a background tab — a build, an
/// agent session, exactly the tabs you are not watching — must not close the tab in front of you.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Fix round 1 (#311 review finding): a reviewer flagged that this class, the only caller of
/// <c>ClosePaneAsync</c>/<c>CloseActivePaneAsync</c> in the repo, exercised exactly one branch
/// (single-leaf pane, background tab, <c>skipConfirm: true</c>), so the split-promotion and
/// confirmation-gate paths the task brief protects had no actual regression coverage despite the
/// report implying otherwise.
///
/// Fix round 2 (#311 review finding): a second reviewer correctly pointed out that the round-1
/// justification for skipping the declined confirmation branch was wrong — <c>TerminalPane.Session</c>
/// (private setter) is reachable by reflection exactly like the private methods this file already
/// invokes, so a fake session with <c>HasActiveChildProcesses = true</c> is entirely possible. That
/// was tried: attach such a stub to a non-SSH, non-WSL pane and call <c>ClosePaneAsync</c> with
/// <c>skipConfirm: false</c>. <c>ShouldAutoAcceptRunningPaneClose</c> does decline as expected, and
/// control reaches <c>ShowRunningProcessCloseConfirmationAsync</c>'s <c>await dialog.ShowDialog(this)</c>
/// — a real, modal <c>Window.ShowDialog</c> with no owner ever shown and no button for anything to
/// click. That call did not return: the test process (<c>testhost.exe</c> and the app's own test
/// host) sat alive and unresponsive well past when the run should have finished, confirmed by
/// checking process start times and having to <c>Stop-Process -Force</c> both to reclaim the build
/// output lock afterward. Even racing the close task against a <c>Task.Delay</c> timeout inside the
/// test did not help — the UI thread was stuck inside <c>ShowDialog</c> itself, so the timeout's
/// continuation never got a turn. The actual, accurate blocker is exactly what round 1 described as
/// unlikely — dismissing a real modal headlessly — not an inability to fake the session state. The
/// declined branch remains uncovered here for that reason.
///
/// Fix round 3 (#311 final review finding D): round 1 added
/// <c>ClosePaneAsync_WithConfirmationEnabled_AutoAcceptsWhenNoProcessIsRunning</c> to cover the
/// auto-accept half of the <c>skipConfirm: false</c> path and claimed it "proves the gate is
/// consulted rather than unconditionally bypassed." That claim does not hold: with
/// <c>IsProcessRunning == false</c>, <c>ShouldAutoAcceptRunningPaneClose</c> auto-accepts, so the
/// pane closes whether <c>ClosePaneAsync</c> actually calls <c>ShouldClosePaneAsync</c> or the
/// <c>!skipConfirm &amp;&amp;</c> check were deleted outright — the test asserts the same
/// <c>closed == true</c> / one-tab-remains outcome either way and cannot fail from that
/// difference. Strengthening it would need a seam that observes whether the gate ran (a spy on
/// <c>ShouldClosePaneAsync</c>, or a way to tell "gate ran and said yes" apart from "gate never
/// ran"), which does not exist and is out of scope to add here. The test was deleted rather than
/// kept as false coverage; the gate's own decision logic
/// (<c>ShouldAutoAcceptRunningPaneClose</c>) already has direct coverage elsewhere (see
/// <c>TabClosePolicyTests</c>), and the declined branch remains uncovered for the modal-deadlock
/// reason described above.

/// saved session on a local run and leaves a file behind that steers the startup path of every
