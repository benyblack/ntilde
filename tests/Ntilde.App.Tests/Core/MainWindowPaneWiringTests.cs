/// them and they reach the window through <c>InitializeRestoredTabs</c> - so every restored pane
/// came up without the graph. With <c>CommandAssistShellIntegrationEnabled</c> defaulting to true
/// independently of the Command Assist master flag, that pane then threw out of
/// <c>ApplyShellIntegrationLaunchPlan</c> while composing its launch, the spawn's catch turned the
/// throw into "[ERROR] Failed to spawn process", and the session was never created: restoring a
/// workspace produced a window full of dead panes.

/// The <see cref="TestAppDataRoot"/> class fixture is taken for its lifetime, not its value,
/// which is why nothing here reads it. Tests in this class close a real <c>MainWindow</c>, and
/// <c>OnClosing</c> saves the session - so without it the suite overwrites the developer's own
/// saved session on a local run and leaves a file behind that steers the startup path of every
/// window built later in the process, which is how #434 reddened main. Scoped per class to match
/// <c>VerticalTabStripTests</c>, whose remarks explain why per-test roots were rejected.
