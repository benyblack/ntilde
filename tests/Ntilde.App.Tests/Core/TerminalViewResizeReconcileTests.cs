/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <c>OnSizeChanged</c> computes a grid and leaves the 60ms throttle to dispatch it. Anything that
/// stops that timer in between - collapsing the pane, hiding it, detaching it - drops the dispatch,
/// and <c>StartUiTimers</c> deliberately does not restart it. The pane then renders one grid while
/// the buffer and the PTY are on another: wrapping stops matching the pane, and nothing recovers it
/// until some later size happens to differ from the one on record.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Recording a dispatch only where it happens is a prerequisite for this and not a cure for it -
/// <c>OnSizeChanged</c> fires on a size <i>change</i>, and a pane that is collapsed and restored
/// comes back at the size it left at, so nothing further arrives to notice. This is the half that
/// re-sends.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Driven through a real window rather than a seam, because the bug is an ordering of real events -
/// layout, visibility, timer - and a test that called the pieces directly would be asserting the
/// order it chose itself.
