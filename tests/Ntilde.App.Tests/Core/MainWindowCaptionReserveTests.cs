/// <summary>
/// Covers <see cref="Ntilde.MainWindow.ComputeCaptionButtonReserve"/>, which replaced the
/// literal 140 in MainWindow.axaml's title bar margin.
///
/// 140 is three 45px caption buttons plus 2px spacing plus the 1px border margin, and it is only
/// right when all three buttons are there. How many are there is not the app's decision: the theme
/// hides minimize and maximize on <c>:not(:has-minimize)</c> / <c>:not(:has-maximize)</c>, and X11
/// sets neither pseudoclass unless the window manager advertises the action. Under a tiling
/// compositor only close survives, so ~94px of the reserve was dead space.
///
/// The lookup that feeds this - hopping to TopLevelHost and translating the strip's origin - needs a
/// real platform window and is not covered here. What is covered is the arithmetic and, more
/// usefully, its behaviour at the edges: every input comes from a live layout pass that can be read
/// mid-transition, and a bad answer here moves the user's buttons off the window.
