/// Codex round 6 on PR #342 (finding at <c>MainWindow.axaml.cs:2252</c>): the title bar's
/// right-click "Customize Title Bar..." entry point used to call <c>OpenSettings(0)</c>, which
/// opens the Appearance tab at its default (top) scroll position - the theme editor and preview,
/// well above the TITLE BAR section further down the same tab. Since that section is not
/// independently discoverable (this menu item exists solely to reach it), landing anywhere else
/// defeats the entry point entirely.
///
/// The fix gives <see cref="Ntilde.SettingsWindow"/> a third constructor parameter,
/// <see cref="Ntilde.SettingsSection"/>, that both (a) forces tab selection to Appearance -
/// the only tab any section currently lives on, regardless of what tab index the caller passed -
/// and (b) schedules a scroll-into-view of the TITLE BAR section header once the window has
/// opened and laid out.
///
/// These tests cover (a) and, per
/// <see cref="Constructing_WithTitleBarSection_ScrollsHeaderIntoView_WhenScrolledAwayBeforehand"/>,
/// (b) as well: round 6 originally reported the actual scroll offset as out of reach in this test
/// host, attributing a stuck-at-zero <c>ScrollViewer.Offset</c> to the headless window never
/// getting real pixel dimensions. That reasoning does not survive inspection - instrumenting the
/// same host showed <c>Window.Bounds</c>, <c>ScrollViewer.Extent</c>, and
/// <c>ScrollViewer.Viewport</c> all resolve to real, non-zero pixel sizes immediately after
/// <c>Show()</c>, even before any <c>RunJobs()</c> call (consistent with round 7's
/// <c>TitleBar.Bounds.Width</c> resolving in the same host). The offset stayed at zero for an
/// unrelated reason: at <see cref="Ntilde.SettingsWindow"/>'s default 880x620 size, the
/// TITLE BAR header already sits inside the initial (zero-offset) viewport, so
/// <c>BringIntoView</c> was a legitimate no-op, not a broken one. See that test for how forcing the
/// header off-screen first makes the assertion meaningful.
