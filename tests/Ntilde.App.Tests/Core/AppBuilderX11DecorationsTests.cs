/// MainWindow is client-side decorated - ExtendClientAreaToDecorationsHint plus
/// NtildeWindowDecorationsTheme draw our own minimize/maximize/close - and on Windows and macOS that
/// opt-in is all it takes. On X11 (what Linux gets from UsePlatformDetect, including under Wayland
/// compositors via XWayland) Avalonia 12 additionally gates drawn decorations behind
/// X11PlatformOptions.EnableDrawnDecorations, which defaults to FALSE. Without it
/// Window.IsExtendedIntoWindowDecorations stays false, WindowDecorationMargin stays 0,0,0,0, the
/// decorations theme is never instantiated, and the buttons do not exist as controls at all - so on
/// a compositor that draws no titlebar of its own (Hyprland, Sway) the window had no close, maximize
/// or minimize affordance whatsoever, and the 140px the title bar overlay reserves for them sat
/// empty. That shipped for the whole Avalonia 12 era because nothing failed: the XAML opt-in is
/// still there and still correct, it was simply inert.
///
/// This is asserted rather than left to manual checking because the failure is silent in every
/// direction. The headless test harness builds its own AppBuilder (see TestAppBuilder), so no other
/// test in the suite touches this method; the compiler is happy either way; and the only symptom is
/// on a platform CI does not run a GUI on.
