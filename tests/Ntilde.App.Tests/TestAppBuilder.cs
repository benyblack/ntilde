// Deliberately NOT AvaloniaTestIsolationLevel.PerAssembly, tempting though it looks: it would
// give one application, set up once on the session's dispatch thread and never torn down, which
// is exactly what the plain-[Fact] callers of SnapshotService.EnsureAvaloniaInitialized would
// like. It also hangs the suite. Between tests the session thread is parked on its work queue and
// never pumps the dispatcher, so any plain [Fact] that marshals onto Dispatcher.UIThread waits
// forever - SshInteractionServiceTests hangs even when run alone. The default PerTest isolation
// resets the dispatcher around every [AvaloniaFact], which is what lets those tests be their own
// UI thread and run the marshalled work inline.
