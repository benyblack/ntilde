/// reached the shell and the shell is alive and echoing - without it, a session that died after
/// painting its prompt, or a <c>SendInput</c> that dropped the write (it swallows the two
/// shutdown-race exceptions by design), would leave before and after trivially equal and the test
/// green having measured nothing. The delete leg then proves three things at once: <c>0x7f</c> is the
/// delete byte, it removes one character per byte, and the two surplus deletes are absorbed rather
/// than eating the prompt.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The final assertion reads the whole cursor row, not just the text behind the cursor. Behind the
/// cursor alone cannot tell "deleted three characters" from "moved the cursor three columns left",
/// which is exactly the vi-command-mode behaviour the planner records as an accepted risk; requiring
/// the probe string to be gone from the row distinguishes them.
