    /// only called <c>RendererStatistics.RecordFrame(...)</c> by hand and asserted the counter moved.
    /// They never rendered anything. `RendererMetricsTests` says as much in a closing comment. A job
    /// that tests the bookkeeping class rather than the renderer is worse than no job: it reads as
    /// coverage.

    /// These tests render for real, through <c>TerminalDrawOperation</c> to an offscreen surface, and
    /// assert on counters rather than on frame *times* — deterministic on a shared CI runner, where a
    /// millisecond threshold would flake. #127 defers timing thresholds to nightly for that reason;
    /// this is the part that can gate a PR today.
