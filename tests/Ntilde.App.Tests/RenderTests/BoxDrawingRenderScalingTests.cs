    /// At RenderScaling 1.5 they did not: TerminalSnapshotRenderer passed the scaling down while
    /// handing the draw operation an unscaled DIP-sized canvas, so a stroke picked as a whole
    /// number of device pixels became a 0.67px rect, antialiasing was off, and it rasterised to
    /// nothing - a border that simply was not drawn.
    ///
    /// Deliberately not a golden-PNG test. GoldenSharedPng is filtered out of every other job and
    /// runs Windows-only, so a baseline is the one thing that would not have caught this on the
    /// machine it was found on. This asserts the pixels directly and runs everywhere.
    ///
    /// In the PlatformBoot lane and the GoldenPng collection like every other snapshot-path
    /// renderer, and for the same reason: SnapshotService.CapturePng boots the Avalonia headless
    /// platform, which binds a thread-affine MediaContext into the process-global locator root.
    /// Any [AvaloniaFact] sharing the process inherits it and throws "The calling thread cannot
    /// access this object because a different thread owns it". This class shipped without either
    /// attribute and spent a week turning the Unit Tests lane red from across the assembly -
    /// TabRunningCommandTests and most of VerticalTabStripTests - because it reaches the boot
    /// through CapturePng rather than by naming EnsureAvaloniaInitialized, which is all the
    /// scheduling guard used to look for.
