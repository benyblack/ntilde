/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Since Phase 0b a pane throws rather than reaching for a static locator, so every test that
/// enables Command Assist has to supply an instance. This one is shared for the whole test process
/// and rooted in a temp directory: shared because that matches production (one graph, one store,
/// one write gate) and keeps concurrent tests off each other's files, temp-rooted because
/// <see cref="CommandAssistServices.CreateDefault"/> would point at the developer's real
/// <c>%APPDATA%</c> history and migrate it to JSONL on first read.
