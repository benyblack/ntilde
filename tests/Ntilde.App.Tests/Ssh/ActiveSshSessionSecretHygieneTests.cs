/// #121: <c>ActiveSshSessionRegistry</c> retains the session password so the remote file browser and
/// path autocomplete can open their own SFTP connections without re-prompting. It used to retain it as a
/// <see cref="string"/>, which cannot be cleared and which the GC may relocate — so plaintext sat on the
/// managed heap for the whole session with no way to wipe it.
///
/// These assert the two properties that changed. They reach into the private buffer by reflection on
/// purpose: the observable API cannot distinguish "forgotten" from "wiped", and *wiped* is the whole
/// point. A test that only checked <c>TryGetRuntimePassword</c> returns false would have passed against
/// the old code.

    // NOT TESTED, deliberately: that the lock prevents a torn read.

    // I wrote that test and then deleted it. It hammered concurrent reads against concurrent
    // Unregisters and asserted every observation was the whole secret or nothing — and it passed
    // just as happily with the lock removed, verified by mutation. The window between taking the
    // array out of the dictionary and decoding it is a few nanoseconds, so a probabilistic test
    // cannot close it, and forcing it would mean a pause seam in production code purely for the
    // test.
    //
    // A test that passes with and without the thing it claims to guard is worse than no test: it
    // reads as coverage. So the lock's justification is stated in the code and left as reasoning,
    // not dressed up as a verified property.
