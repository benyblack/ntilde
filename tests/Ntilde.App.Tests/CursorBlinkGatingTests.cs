    /// pass every 530 ms, per pane, indefinitely.

    /// The rule is tested as a pure function rather than by driving a real control: the
    /// timer only starts once the view is attached, visible and sized, and
    /// IsKeyboardFocusWithin is set by Avalonia's focus manager rather than by a test. A
    /// headless test would therefore pass without the visual tree ever being in the state
    /// the assertion claims to cover - see the PR for what is consequently not covered.
