/// A Help or Fix pass awaits its providers and then posts the surface write to the pane's
/// dispatcher, so a test that drives one and sleeps is betting that the whole round trip fits
/// inside the sleep. On a loaded machine it does not, and the assertion on the far side fails for
/// a reason that has nothing to do with what it is testing (#424). Two tests were losing that bet
/// roughly once per full run.

/// <para>
/// The timeout is generous on purpose: it is there to turn a hang into a legible failure, not to
/// bound the wait tightly. A test that needs the whole two seconds is telling you something real,
/// and the failure reports what actually elapsed so that message is worth reading.
