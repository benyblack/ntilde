/// Releases publish with NativeAOT (see <c>publish_aot</c> in <c>.github/workflows/release.yml</c>,
/// and <c>PublishAot</c> in <c>Ntilde.App.csproj</c>). A reflection binding -
/// <c>{Binding SomePath}</c> evaluated at runtime rather than compiled - resolves its path with
/// <c>Type.GetProperty</c>, and ILC has already trimmed away any property getter no compiled code
/// calls. The binding then silently produces nothing: no exception, no visible error, just a
/// control that renders blank in the installed build while being perfectly fine in every dev build
/// and every test, because those run JIT with full metadata.
///
/// That is not hypothetical. The command palette's item template carried
/// <c>x:CompileBindings="False"</c> and bound <c>{Binding FullTitle}</c> / <c>{Binding Shortcut}</c>.
/// In released Windows builds the palette opened, filtered, and executed on click - all plain C# -
/// but every row's text was invisible, because those two getters were the only readers of
/// <c>TerminalCommand.FullTitle</c> in the whole program and so were not compiled at all.
///
/// ILC does warn (IL2026 + IL3050, pointing at the exact TextBlock lines), but only during
/// <c>dotnet publish -p:PublishAot=true</c> - not on a normal build, and not as an error. The
/// warning shipped in release logs for as long as the bug did. This test moves the signal to where
/// it gets read: a plain unit test that fails on any ordinary <c>dotnet test</c> run.
///
/// The fix for a violation is never to suppress this test. It is to give the template an
/// <c>x:DataType</c> so the binding compiles - see <c>TransferCenter.axaml</c>'s
/// <c>&lt;DataTemplate x:DataType="core:TransferJob"&gt;</c> for the shape.
