/// <c>TitleBarLayout</c>, <c>TitleBarLayoutResolver</c>, <c>TitleBarShortcuts</c>,
/// <c>TitleBarDraftState</c>) and a single Avalonia-touching view layer
/// (<c>TitleBarViewFactory</c>). The pure types are tested with plain <c>[Fact]</c>s that need no
/// UI thread; only <c>TitleBarViewFactory</c>'s tests are <c>[AvaloniaFact]</c>. That split is what
/// keeps most of this feature's ~80 tests fast and headless-friendly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This lives in its own file rather than as another <c>[Fact]</c> in <see cref="LayeringTests"/>
/// because every rule there is assembly-scoped (a <c>private static Assembly</c> accessor plus
/// <c>NotHaveDependencyOnAny</c> across a whole assembly). This rule is namespace-scoped within the
/// single <c>Ntilde.App</c> assembly, with one named exception carved out - a different enough
/// shape that folding it into <c>LayeringTests</c> would blur, not clarify, that file's pattern.
