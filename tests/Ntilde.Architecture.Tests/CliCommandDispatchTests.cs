/// Task 7 fix round 1, finding 1: <c>Ntilde.App/Program.cs</c> is a second CLI dispatch
/// table, separate from the dev-only <c>Ntilde.Cli/Program.cs</c> shim — and it is the one
/// that matters in a shipped self-contained/AOT build, which has no <c>Ntilde.Cli</c>
/// sibling and so must serve every CLI verb itself (see the comment on <c>ReplayCommand</c>'s
/// dispatch in <c>App/Program.cs</c>). <c>BackupCommand</c> shipped wired only into the Cli shim:
/// correct-looking, tested, and unreachable in the build shape the feature actually has to work
/// in — a bare <c>backup export …</c> would fall through every check and launch the GUI.
///
/// This guards against the same mistake recurring for the next CLI command. It cross-checks two
/// "dispatch tables": what CLI-command-shaped types exist (found by reflection over the App
/// assembly for the static <c>IsSupportedCliMode(string[])</c> / <c>Execute(string[], TextWriter,
/// TextWriter, ...)</c> shape every command — <c>SshAskPassCommand</c>, <c>VtReportCommand</c>,
/// <c>ReplayCommand</c>, <c>BackupCommand</c> — already follows) against what is actually
/// dispatched from <c>App/Program.cs</c>'s <c>Main</c>.
///
/// The "is it dispatched" half is a source-text scan rather than more reflection, and that is a
/// deliberate choice, not a shortcut: reflection (or NetArchTest, which is IL/metadata-level too)
/// can enumerate a type's members, but "does <c>Main</c> call this static method" is a question
/// about call sites inside one method body, which needs either IL-instruction inspection of
/// <c>Main</c> (fragile — the dispatcher is a plain if-chain, not a data structure anything can
/// enumerate) or reading the source. A loose <c>"TypeName.IsSupportedCliMode("</c> substring
/// match is enough to catch the actual failure mode (the type is nowhere in the file) without the
/// cost of a full Roslyn parse; a false negative would need a decoy string that names a real
/// command type while dispatching nothing, which is not a realistic accident.
