// `Text = null, // TODO Step 5`, so any grapheme wider than one UTF-16 code unit was *drawn* as
// its first code unit once the line scrolled off screen - an emoji became a lone unpaired
// surrogate, and a combining sequence lost its marks.
//
// The read side was fixed earlier (#95 gap 1) by teaching GetGraphemeAbsolute the same side table,
// which is why selection and copy were already correct while the screen was visibly wrong. This
// covers the drawing half. The viewport path (PopulateRenderCellsFromRow_NoLock) was always
// correct, so the bug appeared only after a line scrolled.
