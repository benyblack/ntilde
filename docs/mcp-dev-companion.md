# Ntilde MCP server

A local, stdio [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server (`src/Ntilde.McpServer`) that
exposes Ntilde to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code, …). It began as a
read-only "dev companion" and now also fronts the **agent host** — opt-in access to live terminal
sessions. Two tool families:

1. **Repo / dev-companion tools** — read-only and offline: project knowledge (architecture,
   schemas, VT conformance, dev workflow). A developer-productivity aid; always available.
2. **Live-session tools (agent host)** — observe, and behind a separate opt-in, act on the running
   app's terminal sessions. A user-facing feature, **off by default**.

## Repo / dev-companion tools

- **Read-only.** Read repository docs and validate theme / SSH-profile / settings JSON against schemas.
- **Offline and sandboxed.** No command execution, no SSH/network, no credentials, no live-session
  access; filesystem reads are confined to `docs/`.

## Live-session tools (agent host)

Proxy the **running** Ntilde app over a per-user local IPC endpoint, gated by explicit,
default-off opt-ins in the app's settings:

- **Observe** (opt-in) — read live sessions: `list_sessions`, `read_screen`, `read_scrollback`,
  `get_session_status`, `wait_for_events`, `export_replay`, `capture_screen`.
- **Act** (a *separate* opt-in, on top of observe) — `send_input`, `spawn_session`,
  `close_session`. SSH targets require a per-profile allowlist, and every acting call — allowed or
  denied — is recorded in an in-app activity journal.

With both toggles off there is no live endpoint at all. See [mcp/security.md](mcp/security.md) and
the [acting threat model](agent-host/2026-07-12-acting-threat-model.md).

## Tools

See [mcp/tools.md](mcp/tools.md) for the authoritative list of both families.

## How to run it locally

The server speaks MCP over **stdio**, so it is normally launched by an MCP client (not run by
hand). The dev-companion tools locate the repository automatically by walking up to
`Ntilde.sln`; you can override that with the `NTILDE_REPO_ROOT` environment variable.
The live-session tools need the Ntilde app running with the opt-ins enabled.

Clients should point at the built DLL, **not** `dotnet run` — `run` emits build/restore
output to stdout, which corrupts the JSON-RPC stream.

**Point the client at the sidecar copy, not at `src/.../bin/`** (#211). The server is a
long-lived process, so while it runs from the repo tree it holds
`Ntilde.AgentHost.Contracts.dll` open, and *every* full repo build then fails with
`MSB3027`/`MSB3021` on the McpServer copy step — whether or not the app is running.
`scripts/run-sidecar.ps1` builds and mirrors the server to a fixed location outside the repo
and prints the exact path to configure:

```powershell
scripts/run-sidecar.ps1                     # builds + mirrors app and MCP server, launches the app
scripts/run-sidecar.ps1 -SkipMcpServer      # app only
```

The script prints the exact path to configure. It lives at:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde-sidecar\McpServer\<Configuration>\net10.0\Ntilde.McpServer.dll
~/.local/share/ntilde-sidecar/McpServer/<Configuration>/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll
```

**Paste the resolved absolute path into client config, not the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` form.** Most
MCP clients hand their `args` straight to the process with no shell involved, so an
environment-variable reference is taken literally and the DLL lookup fails. (`%VAR%` also does
not expand in PowerShell even on a command line.) VS Code is the exception — its `mcp.json`
performs its own `${env:...}` substitution.

Because the mirror is refreshed on every `run-sidecar.ps1` invocation, it cannot go silently
stale the way a hand-made copy does. It does lag while a client holds the server open — the
script warns when it could not refresh, and restarting the MCP client picks up the new build.
The repo stays buildable either way, which is the point.

To run it by hand instead (it speaks stdio, so this is mainly a smoke check):

```bash
dotnet build -c Release src/Ntilde.McpServer
dotnet src/Ntilde.McpServer/bin/Release/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll
```

### Client configuration

- Claude Code (substitute the path `run-sidecar.ps1` printed):
  `claude mcp add ntilde -- dotnet "C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\ntilde-sidecar\McpServer\Debug\net10.0\Ntilde.McpServer.dll"`
- Claude Desktop: [examples/mcp/claude_desktop_config.json](../examples/mcp/claude_desktop_config.json)
- VS Code: [examples/mcp/vscode_mcp_config.json](../examples/mcp/vscode_mcp_config.json)

Point `NTILDE_REPO_ROOT` at your clone so the doc-reading tools resolve. To use the
live-session tools, enable **Settings → Agent access (observe)** in Ntilde (and the
**Agent access (act)** sub-toggle to allow typing/spawning/closing).

## Status

Both the read-only dev companion and the agent-host observe/act surface (milestones A1–A4) ship as
of 0.4.0. Remaining follow-ups are tracked in
[agent-host/known-limitations.md](agent-host/known-limitations.md) and
[agent-host/DIRECTION.md](agent-host/DIRECTION.md).
