# ADR: Ntilde as an Agent Host

_Status: **Accepted** (2026-07-07) · Date: 2026-07-07 · Supersedes the strategic framing of
`docs/ghostty-gaps/ghostty_gap_roadmap.md`; amends Phases 4–5 of `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## Context

### What changed in the industry

Since this project started, the terminal market has bifurcated:

1. **Pure emulators** competing on speed and correctness. Ghostty won this
   race: fastest rendering, strong correctness, a full-time famous maintainer,
   and default-recommendation status in every 2026 comparison.
2. **Agent-aware terminals** built to host CLI coding agents (Claude Code,
   Codex CLI, Gemini CLI). Warp rebranded itself an "Agentic Development
   Environment"; tools like cmux and Agent Deck exist purely to orchestrate
   agent sessions. CLI agents are now a mainstream developer workflow, and the
   terminal a developer chooses materially affects their agent workflow.

What agent-aware terminals compete on today: session observability (agents
reading screen state), session status detection (running / waiting-for-input /
idle), completion & stall notifications, programmatic session spawning, and
parallel-session orchestration. Most implementations are tmux-layer inference
or proprietary. None offer deterministic replay.

### Where Ntilde stands

- Chasing Ghostty on its own axis (speed + correctness as the headline) is
  not winnable for a nights-and-weekends solo project. The gap-closure
  program produced real quality, but as a *strategy* it is a treadmill.
- Ntilde's unusual investments map directly onto what agents need:
  - **Cell-based buffer + VT correctness** → structured, trustworthy screen
    reads ("the agent sees exactly what a human sees").
  - **Thread-safe PTY ownership** → real process/session status, not
    heuristics layered on tmux.
  - **Deterministic replay** → record and replay agent sessions with
    byte-for-byte buffer parity. No other terminal can do this.
  - **Existing MCP server** (`src/Ntilde.McpServer`) → the transport
    and packaging already exist; today it is repo-facing (docs, VT
    explanations, profile validation), not session-facing.
  - **Native SSH profiles** → agents can be given correct remote sessions,
    which no agent-aware terminal offers today.

## Decision

**Ntilde positions itself as the correct, deterministic terminal that is
the best host for AI agents — "enable, don't embed."**

Concretely:

1. Extend the MCP surface from *repo-facing* to *session-facing*: agents can
   observe, query status of, and (with permission) act inside live terminal
   sessions.
2. Do **not** build embedded AI (chat sidebars, model integrations, vendor
   bets). Command Assist remains the only user-facing AI-adjacent surface and
   keeps its existing opt-in constraints.
3. Demote Ghostty gap closure from an active program to a regression gate:
   the VT conformance CI lane stays blocking; new matrix cells are closed
   only when a real TUI application or agent workflow hits them.
4. Treat distribution (brew / winget / Flatpak) as a parallel first-class
   workstream: adoption goals fail on install friction before they fail on
   features.

## Consequences

- VT correctness stops being a me-too feature and becomes the trust
  foundation of the agent story.
- Replay gains a second audience: debugging *agent* behavior, not just
  terminal bugs.
- The McpServer grows a live control path and therefore a security model
  (below). It is no longer "read-only, stdio-only" once Milestone A3 ships;
  README and docs must be updated at that point.
- Roadmap Phases 4–5 (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) are effectively reframed by the
  milestones below; 5.2 Automation Hooks is absorbed into A2.

## Architecture

### Control channel

The MCP server is a standalone stdio process; live sessions exist in the
running App. The design is a **local IPC control endpoint hosted by the App,
proxied by the MCP server**:

```
agent (Claude Code / Codex / …)
   │  stdio MCP
   ▼
Ntilde.McpServer  ── local IPC (named pipe / unix socket) ──▶  Ntilde.App
                                                                    (session registry,
                                                                     buffer snapshots,
                                                                     PTY status, input)
```

- The stdio MCP server remains the single public surface; the IPC contract is
  internal and versioned.
- The App endpoint is loopback-only, per-user, and off by default
  (`Settings → Agent Access`).
- Buffer reads go through the existing snapshot boundary — the same
  deterministic serializer the replay/parity tests use. No new read path.

### Module placement (respects enforced invariants)

- Session-control contracts (DTOs, IPC protocol) live in a new leaf library
  (working name `Ntilde.AgentHost.Contracts`) referenced by both App
  and McpServer. `VT` stays a leaf; `Pty` still never sees VT types — status
  events surface via the existing App orchestration layer.
- No production assembly references test libraries; architecture tests gain
  assertions for the new edges before the first merge.

### Permission model

| Capability | Default | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| list sessions, read screen/scrollback, session status | off | user enables Agent Access (observe) |
| notifications (completion / stall) | off | same toggle |
| live indicators (pane status segment, tab marker, window light) | off | tied to observe / act; cannot be silenced separately |
| send input, spawn/close sessions & panes | off | separate explicit opt-in, per-profile allowlist for SSH |
| replay export | off | observe permission + explicit export action |
| screenshot (render a pane to PNG) | off | observe permission |

Every acting tool call is journaled to a visible activity log in the UI. A
screenshot is not: it acts on nothing, and the pane's own agent-access indicator
(A5 follow-up, #339) lights when an agent captures it, which is the surface a
user actually watches.
Nothing is silent — same principle as the credential-consent rules.

## Roadmap

Each milestone is independently shippable and announceable. Estimates assume
~5–15 hrs/week.

### A1 — Observe (first public demo)

**Deliverables**
- [x] App-side IPC endpoint + session registry exposure (PRs #183, #184)
- [x] MCP tools: `ntilde.list_sessions`, `ntilde.read_screen`
      (visible grid + cursor), `ntilde.read_scrollback` (ranged)
- [x] `Agent Access (observe)` settings toggle, off by default (PR #184)
- [ ] Docs + demo recording: Claude Code reading a live `htop`/`vim` session

**Acceptance criteria**
- Screen reads are snapshots from the deterministic serializer; a replay of
  the same byte stream yields an identical `read_screen` result (parity test)
- Zero behavior change when the toggle is off (architecture + integration test)

### A2 — Status & notifications

**Deliverables**
- [x] Session status model: `running` / `awaitingInput` / `idle` / `exited`
      with precise/heuristic confidence tiers (PTY-derived, not scrape-based;
      exit status included; foreground-process reporting deferred) (PR #186)
- [x] MCP tools: `ntilde.get_session_status`,
      `ntilde.wait_for_events` (cursor long-poll over a bounded event
      ring) for completion/stall events (PRs #187, #188)
- [x] In-app notification for long-running command completion, default-off
      toggle (absorbs ROADMAP 5.2); OS-native notification backends remain a
      follow-up

**Acceptance criteria**
- Status transitions covered by replay-driven tests (recorded fixtures per
  state)
- Stall detection has an explicit, documented definition (no output for N s
  while `running`) — no heuristics that can't be tested

### A3 — Act (permissioned)

**Deliverables**
- [x] MCP tools: `ntilde.send_input` (PR #193), `ntilde.spawn_session`
      (local profile or SSH profile by name) + `ntilde.close_session` (PR #194)
- [x] Separate opt-in (`AgentAccessActEnabled`, default off) + per-profile SSH
      allowlist (`SshProfile.AllowAgentAccess`, fail-closed) + UI activity journal
      (`AgentActivityJournal` + "Agent Activity…" window; every attempt, allowed or
      denied, is recorded) (PRs #193–#195)
- [x] Threat-model doc for the acting surface
      (`docs/agent-host/2026-07-12-acting-threat-model.md`, PR #195)

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Acting tools hard-fail when only observe permission is granted (tested:
      `actDisabled`; SSH also `profileNotAllowed`)
- [x] Input injection is byte-faithful and replay-recorded like any PTY input
      (goes through the session's normal `SendInput`; PtySmoke asserts the recorded
      input event)

**Milestone A3 complete.** Design: `docs/plans/2026-07-12-agent-host-a3-act-design.md`.

### A4 — Replay for agents (the moat)

**Deliverables**
- [x] `ntilde.export_replay` for a session/time range (PRs #190–#191:
      flight-recorder ring bounded by bytes = the retained time range; output +
      resize only, never input; gated by the default-off `AgentReplayExportEnabled`
      sub-toggle on top of observe)
- [x] CLI: `Ntilde.Cli --replay <file> [--attributes]` headless
      render-to-text for CI and agent-run postmortems (PR #192; PNG output and
      frame-stepping deferred — see the A4 design doc's out-of-scope list)
- [x] Docs: "Debug what your agent did, frame by frame" (README, agent host
      program section)

**Acceptance criteria**
- Exported replays round-trip through the existing replay runner with
  byte-identical buffer snapshots on all three OSes

### A5 — Screenshots (see what the agent sees)

**Deliverables**
- [x] `ntilde.capture_screen`: captures a pane as a PNG and returns its
      path, plus the image inline on request (size-capped, `maxWidth`
      downscale). Rides the observe toggle like every other read; the pane
      indicator is its visibility surface.
- [x] Two modes, as the design doc specified: `render` (default, deterministic,
      works on hidden panes) and `live` (WYSIWYG through the UI-thread bridge,
      visible panes only, carries the background image and window opacity).
- [x] Caller-named `scale` (1–3) so an agent can render text large enough to
      read back out of the image. Named by the caller, never taken from the
      monitor, so a capture stays reproducible. Unblocked by #346.
- [x] The snapshot renderer (`TerminalSnapshotRenderer`) promoted out of test
      infrastructure into the App, so the golden-PNG baselines, the agent
      capture path, and any future CLI PNG output are one code path. Renders
      through the real `TerminalDrawOperation` with no window, visual tree, or
      GPU surface — a minimized or occluded window captures identically, and
      nothing outside the pane can appear in the image.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Two captures of an unchanged buffer are byte-identical at a given scale
      (scale named by the caller rather than taken from the monitor, cursor
      follows the buffer's mode rather than a blink phase, no selection or
      render HUD)
- [x] `render` mode hard-fails with `captureUnavailable` for a pane that has not
      been measured, and for one whose grid exceeds the pixel budget *in device
      pixels* — the budget is squared by scale, so a grid that fits at 1x can
      miss at 3x
- [x] `live` mode hard-fails with `captureUnavailable`, pointing back at
      `render`, when there is no window or the pane is not on screen
- [x] An unrecognized mode is a malformed request rather than being coerced to
      the default

### Parallel track — Distribution

- [ ] winget manifest (Windows)
- [ ] Flatpak (Linux)
- [ ] Each A-milestone announcement links a one-command install

## Non-goals

- Embedded chat UI, model API keys, or any model-vendor dependency
- Agent orchestration UI (fleets, worktree-per-task) — v1 hosts sessions;
  orchestrators like cmux can build *on* the MCP surface
- Remote (network-exposed) control endpoint
- Weakening any existing invariant: determinism, parity, replayability, and
  the zero-flicker rule gate this work exactly as they gate everything else

## Final rule (unchanged)

> **If it is not testable, it is not shippable.**

Agent-facing reads and events are only trustworthy because they are built on
the deterministic core — that is the product.
