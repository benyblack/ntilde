# Agent-host smoke test (pre-0.4.0)

Manual verification of A1–A4 on a real build before tagging 0.4.0. Layered — stop
after any layer. Each check lists the action, the expected result, and the red flag.

Paths assume the repo at its current location; adjust as needed. Config/state lives
under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde` (settings.json, agent-endpoint.json, recordings\).

## 0. Build & launch

- [ ] Build everything:
  ```
  scripts/build.ps1 build Ntilde.sln
  ```
  Expected: 0 errors. Red flag: any error (a warning flood is normal).

- [ ] Launch the app (run the built exe directly — the wrapper doesn't do `run`):
  ```
  src\Ntilde.App\bin\Debug\net10.0\Ntilde.exe
  ```
  Expected: window opens, a shell tab is live. Red flag: crash → check
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde\logs\startup_error.txt`.

- [ ] Build the MCP server (Release) and wire it to Claude Code:
  ```
  scripts/build.ps1 build -c Release src/Ntilde.McpServer
  claude mcp add ntilde -- dotnet "<REPO>\src\Ntilde.McpServer\bin\Release\net10.0\Ntilde.McpServer.dll"
  ```
  (Any MCP client works; do NOT use `dotnet run` — it corrupts stdio.) In a Claude
  Code session, confirm the `ntilde.*` tools appear.

## 1. Off-is-off (default state)

With **all** agent toggles off (fresh settings):

- [ ] Ask the agent: run `ntilde.list_sessions`.
  Expected: the "unavailable / enable Agent access (observe)" guidance, not data.
- [ ] Confirm there is **no** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde\agent-endpoint.json` (or it is
  empty). Red flag: an endpoint file exists while observe is off.

## 2. Settings toggles persist (UI)

Settings → the Agent access rows:

- [ ] Verify three toggles exist: **Agent access (observe)**, **Agent replay
  export** (indented), **Agent access (act)** (indented). Toggle observe on,
  others off; Save. (Screenshots have no toggle of their own - they ride observe.)
- [ ] Reopen Settings — observe still on. Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde\settings.json`:
  `AgentAccessObserveEnabled: true`, `AgentReplayExportEnabled: false`,
  `AgentAccessActEnabled: false`. Red flag: values don't round-trip.
- [ ] With observe now on, `agent-endpoint.json` appears next to settings.json.

## 3. Observe + status (A1/A2) — observe ON only

Have a couple of tabs open; run something interactive (e.g. `vim` or a `ping -t`).

- [ ] `ntilde.list_sessions` → lists panes with paneId, title, kind, size,
  status. Red flag: empty while tabs are open, or wrong kind.
- [ ] `ntilde.read_screen <paneId>` → the visible grid matches what you see,
  including cursor position. Red flag: stale/garbled content, wrong wrapping.
- [ ] `ntilde.read_scrollback <paneId>` → history lines, oldest first.
- [ ] Start a long command (`ping -n 20 localhost`), then
  `ntilde.get_session_status <paneId>` → `running`; after it finishes →
  `idle`/`awaitingInput`. Red flag: status stuck on the wrong state.
- [ ] `ntilde.wait_for_events` with the long command running → returns a
  `commandFinished` (or status) event when it completes, rather than timing out
  every call. Red flag: never delivers the completion event.

## 4. Replay export (A4) — enable "Agent replay export"

- [ ] With observe + replay-export on, produce some output in a pane, then
  `ntilde.export_replay <paneId>`.
  Expected: returns a path under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde\recordings\agent-exports\`
  and an event count. Red flag: `exportDisabled` (toggle didn't apply) or a path
  that doesn't exist.
- [ ] Confirm the file exists and, opening it, that it contains `data`/`resize`
  lines but **no `input` lines** (privacy). Red flag: any `"type":"input"`.
- [ ] Replay it headlessly through the CLI:
  ```
  dotnet src\Ntilde.Cli\bin\Debug\net10.0\Ntilde.Cli.dll --replay "<exported .rec path>"
  ```
  Expected: prints the final screen; exit code 0. Red flag: crash, or an empty
  screen for a session that clearly had output.
- [ ] Turn "Agent replay export" **off**, retry `export_replay` → `exportDisabled`.

## 4b. Screenshots (A5) - observe only, no extra toggle

- [ ] With only observe on, `capture_screen <paneId>` returns a `ntilde_screen_*.png`
  path under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ntilde\recordings\agent-exports\`, with the
  pane's grid size. Open it: it should look like that pane - same font, same theme,
  same text - with no tab bar or other chrome. Red flag: `captureDisabled` (the
  gate was supposed to be gone), transparent background, or the wrong pane.
- [ ] Run something with colour and box drawing (e.g. `htop` in WSL, or any TUI)
  and capture again: colours and borders should match the screen.
- [ ] `capture_screen <paneId>` with `inline=true` returns the image in the tool
  result, not just a path.
- [ ] `capture_screen <paneId>` with `maxWidth=400` gives a smaller image; the
  result says it was downscaled to fit maxWidth.
- [ ] `capture_screen <paneId>` with `scale=3` gives an image three times the
  width and height of the 1x capture, with legible text - and box-drawing borders
  still drawn, which is the bug #346 fixed. `scale=99` clamps to 3 rather than
  erroring.
- [ ] **Minimize the window** (or cover it completely) and capture again with the
  default mode: the same image as before, not a blank or clipped one. This is the
  offscreen-render guarantee. Red flag: an empty or black image while minimized.
- [ ] Capture the same idle pane twice and compare the files byte for byte
  (`fc /b` on Windows, `cmp` elsewhere): identical. Red flag: differing bytes for
  an unchanged screen.
- [ ] `capture_screen <paneId>` with `mode=live` gives an image that includes your
  background image and window opacity, which `render` omits. Then select a
  **different tab** and repeat: `live` reports `captureUnavailable` and points at
  `render`, while `render` still captures the hidden pane.
- [ ] `capture_screen <paneId>` with `mode=wysiwyg` is a malformed request naming
  the two valid modes, and writes no file.
- [ ] The captured pane's **agent-access indicator** lights (the status-bar
  reading segment, per #339). That, not the journal, is where a capture shows up.
- [ ] The **Agent Activity** window does *not* list the captures: the journal is
  the acting record, and a capture acts on nothing.

## 5. Act gating (A3) — the security-critical checks

**5a. Act still OFF (observe on):**
- [ ] `ntilde.send_input` (any paneId, text `"echo hi\r"`) → **`actDisabled`**;
  nothing is typed into the terminal. Red flag: the text actually runs.
- [ ] `ntilde.spawn_session` and `ntilde.close_session` likewise →
  `actDisabled`.

**5b. Turn "Agent access (act)" ON:**
- [ ] `send_input <local paneId>` `"echo agent-was-here\r"` → the command runs in
  that pane; result reports bytes sent. Red flag: nothing typed, or wrong pane.
- [ ] `spawn_session` (no profile) → a new tab opens; returns a paneId. `spawn_session`
  with a **local profile name** → tab for that profile.
- [ ] `close_session <paneId>` → that pane/tab closes **without** a confirmation
  dialog. Red flag: a modal blocks it, or it reports success but the pane stays.

**5c. SSH allowlist (no live host needed):**
- [ ] Create an SSH connection profile (host can be anything). Leave "Allow AI agent
  access to this connection" (Advanced tab) **unchecked**.
- [ ] `spawn_session "<that SSH profile name>"` → **`profileNotAllowed`**; no tab
  opens. Red flag: it opens/connects anyway.
- [ ] Check the box, Save, retry → the spawn is permitted (the tab opens even if the
  host is unreachable; a connect error in the pane is fine — the gate passed).
- [ ] Uncheck it again, Save, edit any other field, Save, reopen → the box is still
  unchecked (revoke sticks; the allowlist round-trips).

## 6. Activity journal (A3) — "nothing is silent"

- [ ] New-tab menu (`+`) → **Agent Activity…** opens a window.
- [ ] It lists the recent actions from steps 5a/5b — including the **denied**
  `actDisabled` / `profileNotAllowed` attempts, newest first, each with method,
  outcome, and target. Red flag: denied attempts missing, or the window empty after
  you've acted.
- [ ] Refresh picks up new entries after another `send_input`.

## 7. Revocation

- [ ] Turn **Agent access (observe)** off (Save). `agent-endpoint.json` is emptied,
  and any `ntilde.*` tool now returns the unavailable guidance — including the
  act tools (act rides on observe being up). Red flag: tools still work after observe
  is off.

---

### Notes
- If a tool returns "could not be parsed", the app and MCP server are from different
  builds — rebuild both.
- Step 4 uses the dev CLI (`Ntilde.Cli`) for convenience. The release bundle
  ships no separate CLI — the app executable serves `--replay` itself
  (`Ntilde --replay "<.rec>"`), so that is the end-user invocation.
- These are the surfaces verified by build/logic tests but not visually in this
  cycle: the four toggles, the SSH allowlist checkbox, and the Agent Activity
  window. Steps 2, 5c, and 6 are the highest-value manual confirmations.
- Step 4b's determinism, scale, budget and mode-dispatch behaviour is covered
  headlessly by `AgentHostCaptureProtocolTests`. What only a human can confirm is
  that the image actually *looks like* the pane (font, theme, box drawing), and
  that `mode=live` really does carry the background image - the live path needs a
  real visual tree, so no headless test exercises its pixels.
