# Remote shell integration (SSH)

Command Assist reads the OSC 133 marks a shell emits: `A` (prompt start), `B` (prompt end — the
first cell of your input), `C` (the line you submitted), `D` (exit code and duration), plus OSC 7
for the working directory. On a local session Ntilde installs the emitter for you. Over SSH it
cannot: every injection mechanism it has — a `bash --rcfile` path, a `ZDOTDIR` or
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` override, a pwsh `-File` bootstrap — dies at the SSH boundary.

So you install it on the remote host once, and from then on that host's sessions behave like local
integrated ones.

## What you get

| | Un-instrumented SSH | Instrumented SSH |
|---|---|---|
| History capture | typed-straight-through lines only, heuristic | every command, from the `133;C` payload, tagged `ShellIntegration` |
| Exit codes and durations in history | no | yes, from `133;D` |
| Suggestions while you type | none (there is no readable command line) | yes, read from the grid between `B` and the cursor |
| `Ctrl+Enter` insertion into the command line | refused | yes |
| Fix mode after a failure | command text only when the heuristic caught it | always |
| Overlay placement | conservative band heuristic, suppressed on short panes | anchored to the `133;B` mark |
| Filesystem path suggestions | off | **still off** — see below |

Path suggestions stay off for every remote session, instrumented or not.
`FileSystemPathSuggestionProvider` completes against the machine Ntilde is running on, and over SSH
that is the wrong filesystem: it would offer your laptop's directories at a prompt sitting on the
server. Completing the remote filesystem needs a remote listing channel, which is the remote-files
sidebar's problem and not this one.

## Install

Settings → **Command assistant** → **Remote shell integration**: pick the remote shell, press
**Copy installer**, paste the one line at the prompt on that host, press Enter. It prints what it
did:

```
ntilde: wrote ~/.ntilde-shell-integration.sh
ntilde: added loader line to ~/.zshrc
ntilde: run  . ~/.ntilde-shell-integration.sh  to enable it in this session,
ntilde: or open a new Ntilde session to this host.
```

One line and one history entry, rather than a 300-line paste. The line decodes a
gzipped copy of the snippet into a temp file, runs it as a **child process**, and deletes it. It
never sources anything into your live shell: the shell's identity is expanded by your shell and
handed to the installer as an argument, so it knows whether to patch `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
without touching your session. Running it twice changes nothing the second time — the loader line is
added only if it isn't already there, including when you placed it by hand. A line that only
*mentions* the file inside a comment does not count as already there.

If it cannot write your rc file — root-owned, `chattr +i`, a read-only `$HOME`, a full disk — it
says so, prints the loader line for you to add by hand, and exits non-zero. It never reports a
change it did not make.

Integration starts with your next session to that host. The third line above is there if you want it
sooner in the shell you pasted into.

fish needs no loader line at all: its snippet goes to `~/.config/fish/conf.d/`, which fish sources
automatically.

### The 4096-byte paste limit

The one line is about 8.5 KB for bash/zsh and for pwsh. A tty in **canonical mode** discards
everything past 4096 bytes of a single line (`N_TTY_BUF_SIZE`), so on those hosts those two lines do
not survive the paste. fish's is under 4 KB (its snippet is a third the size) and is not affected.

Interactive bash, zsh and fish put the tty in raw mode — readline, ZLE, fish's own reader — so a
normal SSH session to a normal login shell is fine, which is the case you will hit almost every
time. Canonical mode is what you get at `docker exec -it <c> sh`, on busybox/Alpine `ash`, with
`dash` as `/bin/sh`, on serial and IPMI consoles, and in pwsh without PSReadLine.

**What it looks like when it happens.** The base64 payload starts at byte 9 or 10 of the line and
runs past byte 7500, so a cut at 4096 always lands in the middle of it and takes the closing quote
with it. Your shell therefore rejects the line outright — nothing of Ntilde's runs, nothing is
written, and there is no `ntilde:` message:

```
bash: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
```

bash and zsh may instead sit at a `>` continuation prompt waiting for the quote to be closed; press
Ctrl-C. pwsh says `The string is missing the terminator: '.`

The fix on such a host is **Copy plain snippet**, or paste the one line into a file and run the
file.

The one-liner *does* carry its own payload length and check it before decoding, but that guard is
for a different failure: bytes lost from the **middle** of the line while the end still arrives — a
flaky link, a multiplexer dropping a chunk of a paste. There it reports `ntilde: install failed - the
pasted line was cut short (N of M payload characters)` instead of blaming `base64`/`gzip` for a
decode failure they did not cause.

### Placing the file yourself

**Copy plain snippet** puts the whole file on the clipboard instead, and the row tells you where it
goes. That is the path for a dotfiles repo, `/etc/profile.d`, or reading the snippet before you
trust it — the installers themselves are readable files in the repository under
`assets/shell-integration/install/`.

## What the snippets promise

Everything the local bootstrap builders promise, for the same reasons, with the guards ported
across:

- **Your prompt is appended to, never replaced.** bash gets `\[\e]133;B\a\]` on the tail of `PS1`,
  re-applied every prompt cycle from the last entry in the `PROMPT_COMMAND` chain so a theme that
  rewrites `PS1` there cannot drop it. zsh gets a `%{...%}`-wrapped suffix on `PROMPT`, stripped and
  re-appended each `precmd` so a hook registered after ours cannot bury it mid-prompt. fish's
  `fish_prompt` is copied aside and wrapped. PowerShell's `prompt` is captured once and called from
  a wrapper.
- **Sourcing twice is a no-op.** A load guard covers the ordinary case; the bash `PROMPT_COMMAND`
  chain, the zsh hook arrays, the fish `fish_prompt` copy and the pwsh `prompt` capture each carry
  their own not-already-wrapped guard as well, because a framework that rebuilds one of those after
  we install can defeat the load guard alone.
- **Non-interactive shells emit nothing.** An OSC written into an `scp` or `rsync` stream corrupts
  the transfer, so the sh and fish snippets bail before defining anything when the shell is not
  interactive.
- **The bash `C` payload is the whole line.** `$BASH_COMMAND` in a `DEBUG` trap is the first
  *simple command*, not the line the user submitted: on `true && false` it is `true`, which would be
  recorded next to the other branch's exit code. The snippet reads the line back out of `history 1`
  (bash-preexec's approach) and falls back to `$BASH_COMMAND` only where history cannot answer —
  `set +o history`, or a leading-space command swallowed by `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`.
- **Missing pieces degrade rather than fail.** No `EPOCHREALTIME` means second-resolution durations
  instead of milliseconds. No PSReadLine is the one lossy case: the Enter chord is where the pwsh
  snippet emits `133;C` *and* starts the clock, so without it you get OSC 7, `A` and `B` and
  **no `C` and no `D`** — no command text, no exit codes, no durations. Suggestions still work
  (the grid read between `B` and the cursor does not need `C`); history capture falls back to the
  same heuristic an un-instrumented session uses.

## Third-party integrations

You do not have to use Ntilde's snippets. Anything that emits OSC 133 works — iTerm2's
`shell_integration`, VS Code's `shell-integration.sh`, `starship`'s, a hand-rolled one. Ntilde's
parser has never cared who wrote the marks.

Two things to know about the third-party ones:

- **A bare `133;C` is fine.** FinalTerm does not require a payload and several integrations send
  none. Ntilde treats a payload-less `C` as the lifecycle edge it is — the command-input window
  closes, the suggestion surface goes quiet, `D` still patches the exit code — and falls back to
  reading the command line off the grid at Enter for history. You lose nothing but the guarantee
  that a multi-line or edited command is recorded exactly.
- **A plain-text `133;C;git status` is also fine**, and is read as written. `133;C;aid=7` is not
  treated as a command: FinalTerm allows `key=value` attributes on these marks, and writing `aid=7`
  into your permanent history would be worse than recording nothing.

## What Ntilde does with the marks

Arming is unconditional for SSH panes: the OSC 133 translator is attached when the session starts,
before any mark has arrived, because `A` and the first `B` arrive with the very first remote prompt
and a translator armed after them would miss the mark that opens the first command-input window.
It is inert on a host with no snippet — every path into it is a mark callback — so an
un-instrumented SSH session behaves exactly as it did before.

The session is promoted to "integrated" the first time any mark arrives, and Command Assist's
context reaches the same conclusion independently from the event stream, so the promotion cannot be
lost to a race or undone by an unrelated directory change.

Arming does **not** consult `CommandAssistPowerShellIntegrationEnabled`. That setting exists to let
you keep Ntilde from *injecting* a bootstrap into a local pwsh, which is the operation people turn off
because it interacts badly with a hand-built profile. Over SSH there is no injection to decline, the
emitter is one the user installed themselves, and the pane has no way to know which shell is on the
far end at arm time anyway — so remote arming is governed by the general shell-integration switch
alone.

Turning **shell integration** off in Settings turns off remote consumption too, and that covers all
three consumers, not just the arming: the tracker is not armed, the "this session is integrated"
latch does not flip, and a `133;C` payload is not adopted as the pane's last relevant command. It is
the same switch that decides whether Ntilde injects locally, and a remote host is the one place where
you cannot simply uninstall the emitter. (Mark-based overlay *anchoring* is not gated on it — that
path reads the parser's mark directly and predates the switch having a remote meaning.)

## Threat model

**What you are pasting.** The installer line carries the whole snippet inline, gzipped and
base64-encoded. There is no `curl`, no `wget`, no URL and no network fetch: nothing is downloaded at
paste time, so there is no window between copying the line and running it in which a server, a CDN,
a DNS answer or a TLS interception could substitute different content, and it works on a host with
no outbound network at all. That is a real property and it is worth having.

It is also the whole of the mitigation, and it is worth being plain about what it does not cover.
What you paste is an ~8 KB opaque blob, and there is nothing on the remote host — or in the pasted
line — that lets you check it against the reviewable sources in `assets/shell-integration/install/`
and `assets/shell-integration/`. There is no checksum you can compare, because a checksum shipped
alongside the blob by the same build is not evidence. You are trusting the Ntilde build that produced
the clipboard contents, exactly as much as you would trust a script it downloaded for you, minus the
network. Pasting opaque blobs into production servers is a habit worth being deliberate about, and
this feature does encourage it.

If that trade is wrong for a particular host, **Copy plain snippet** puts the readable file on the
clipboard instead. It is the same content, in a form you can read before you run it and diff against
the repository, and the rest of what the installer does is two commands you can do by hand: write
the file, add one loader line to your rc file (the exact line is in the row next to the button, and
above in this page).

**What an instrumented remote session lets the far end do.** OSC 133 marks are bytes on the pane's
output stream, and nothing about a byte stream says who wrote it. On an SSH session that means the
remote host — or anything running on it, or anything that can get output onto that stream — can
write a `133;C;<base64>` and have the text inside it become a **command history entry**, tagged
`ShellIntegration`, attributed to the pane's host and working directory. History is global and
cross-session, so that entry is then ranked and suggested in *other* sessions, including local ones.
A hostile or compromised host can therefore seed your history with text you never typed and see it
offered back to you later somewhere else.

This is inherent to the OSC 133 contract and not specific to Ntilde: iTerm2, VS Code's terminal and
WezTerm all consume the same marks from the same untrusted stream, and all of them will record what
a remote host asserts about the command it ran. Ntilde's snippets do not create the exposure; enabling
consumption of anyone's marks does. Note that there is a pre-existing **local** equivalent, which
Phase 2b does not change: any local integrated pane rendering untrusted output — a `cat` of a
crafted file, a build log, `curl | less` — is a stream that can carry a `133;C` just as well.

**What it does not let the far end do.**

- **Nothing is executed.** A history entry is text. Getting it to run requires the user to select
  the suggestion and press Enter; insertion is explicit and the inserted text is visible in the
  command line before it is submitted.
- **Suggestions are never auto-submitted**, and `Ctrl+Enter` insertion puts the text on the command
  line rather than running it.
- **Redaction still runs.** The secrets filter is applied to structured entries on the same path as
  heuristic ones, so a payload shaped like a credential is redacted before it is stored.
- **Filesystem path suggestions stay off** for every remote session (see above), so nothing the
  remote asserts can steer a local path completion.
- **Volume is bounded.** At most one structured entry is recorded per prompt cycle, and a `133;C`
  payload over 8 KiB is dropped before it is decoded. A host cannot flood history from a single
  prompt.

**The escape hatch.** Set `CommandAssistShellIntegrationEnabled` to `false` (Settings → Command
assistant → shell integration). With it off, remote marks are parsed but not consumed: no tracker,
no integrated-session promotion, no structured capture, no adoption of the `C` payload as the
session's last command. The cost is that local injection stops too — it is deliberately one switch,
because "participate in the OSC 133 contract" is one decision.

**Follow-up (not in this change): surface provenance at suggestion time.** A remote-sourced history
entry is visually identical to a locally typed one in the suggestion list today. The entry already
carries `IsRemote`, `HostId` and `Source`, so the data is there; what is missing is showing it, so a
user can tell "this came from `prod-web-3`" from "you typed this". Tracked as the natural next step
once there is a second reason to touch the suggestion row rendering.

## Troubleshooting

- **The paste produced an unmatched-quote error, or the shell sits at a `>` prompt.** The host's tty
  is in canonical mode and cut the line at 4096 bytes — see
  [The 4096-byte paste limit](#the-4096-byte-paste-limit). Nothing was written; nothing of Ntilde's
  ran.
- **`ntilde: install failed - the pasted line was cut short`.** Different failure: the line arrived
  but with bytes missing from the middle. Retry the paste; if it keeps happening the transport is
  dropping data.
- **`ntilde: install failed - this host needs a working base64 and gzip`.** This one means what it
  says — the host could not decode the payload (on bash/zsh and pwsh its length was checked first,
  so it did arrive whole).
  busybox and coreutils both provide `base64` and `gzip`; a hardened `$PATH` that hides them is the
  other common cause. Use **Copy plain snippet** if you would rather not install anything.
- **`ntilde: install failed - mktemp could not create a temp file`.** No `mktemp` on the host, or
  `$TMPDIR` is unwritable or mounted `noexec`. There is deliberately no fallback temp path: a
  predictable name in `/tmp` is a symlink attack on a shared host.
- **`ntilde: could not write ~/.bashrc - add this line to it by hand`.** The snippet was written; only
  the rc edit failed. Add the line it printed, or fix the rc file's permissions and re-run.
- **Nothing changed.** Marks only take effect on a *new* session; sourcing the snippet into a shell
  Ntilde is already attached to works, but the prompt has to repaint at least once for `B` to land.
- **Suggestions appear but history stays empty.** Check `CommandAssistHistoryEnabled`; capture is
  gated separately from the feature.
- **Duplicate prompt marks / doubled output.** Something re-sourced the snippet in a way that
  defeated the load guard. Open a fresh session; if it persists, the culprit is a prompt framework
  rebuilding the hook chain after us — file it with the framework name.
- **The overlay still sits in the lower band.** That is the markless fallback, so no mark is
  reaching Ntilde. Confirm the remote shell is the one you instrumented (`echo $0`) and that the
  session is interactive.
