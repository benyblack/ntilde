# Issue Triage — 2026-07-27

**Scope:** all 28 open issues on `benyblack/ntilde` at `main@1aee7c3`.
**Method:** every claim in every issue body was re-verified against the current
source tree. No code was changed. Verdicts below are backed by `file:line`
evidence; where an issue's premise no longer holds, that is called out
explicitly.

**Headline:** 1 issue is fully obsolete, 6 issues are materially stale (large
parts already fixed by later PRs), and 1 security issue is a genuine
arbitrary-file-write that should be the next thing anyone touches.

> **Update 2026-07-29** — re-verified against `main@1aee7c3`; every `file:line`
> claim below held. Actions taken since:
>
> - **#166 closed** (not planned — file deleted in #176) and **#81 closed**
>   (completed — remaining re-gating item folded into #117).
> - **#104 + #144 fixed and merged** as PR #210 (squash `29ae428`). Review surfaced
>   three further defects in the fix itself, all addressed: the `.ntildepart` scratch
>   name was deterministic (concurrent transfers to one destination could interleave
>   — `SftpService` runs each job on its own `Task.Run` with no per-destination

> - **#107 items (a) + (b) merged** as PR #214 (`5c8e98a`). Issue stays open for (c),
>   which #109 must own. Review caught two further defects in the fix: reporting the
>   failure exit without tearing the session down left the child process alive, and the
>   init-script cleanup raced `Dispose`. Both fixed before merge.
> - **PR #213 merged** (`90c9b3d`): pins that rename replaces an existing destination,
>   after review of #210 suspected a Windows defect there. Probed empirically — the
>   defect does not reproduce; the assumption was just untested.
> - **#211 filed**: the MCP dev companion runs from `bin/`, so a connected client blocks
>   repo builds. Docs/DX, P3.
>
> - **Quick-win batch done.** `#174` (PR #217, closed), `#126` (PR #219, closed), `#95 gap 1`
>   (PR #220, issue stays open for gaps 2-6), `#182` (PR #221, closed). Plus `#117 item 1`

> **Findings worth carrying forward:**
>
> - **`dotnet format` fails on `main`** — 649 whitespace violations across 79 files,
>   pre-existing. Filed as **#216**. `ci/run.*` therefore reports rather than gates on it.
>   ~480 of the 649 are in `TerminalDrawOperation.cs` and `TerminalBuffer.ReflowEngine.cs`,
>   the files #113 and #164 will touch — sequence the sweep against those.
> - **`dotnet test --no-build --settings <file>` silently does nothing** on this SDK: exit 0,

>   source instead.
> - **PTY injection timing is load-bearing** for
>   `PtySmokeTests.AgentSentInput_IsByteFaithful`. Two separate changes to PTY timing broke
>   it (#214, #218) before the underlying race was fixed at its source.
> - **`RustPtySession` starts its loops in the constructor**, so anything subscribing to its
>   events can miss one that already fired. Bit a test in #215.
> - **Real-shell PTY tests now share one xUnit collection** (#218). Adding a new one outside
>   that collection reintroduces the starvation that broke the flight-recording test.
> - **Coverage baseline: `Ntilde.VT` 53.2% line / 47.86% branch**, floor 50%.
>   Understates true coverage because `App.Tests` — which holds the buffer and reflow suites
>   — is excluded from the coverage loop, mirroring the gating lane's #81 exclusion.
>
> - **#108 started** (PR #223): 6 of 18 projects now build with
>   `TreatWarningsAsErrors`. Real count is **1822 unique diagnostics across 13 projects**,
>   not the ~350 `Directory.Build.props` documents. Ladder and a detailed batch-2 analysis
>   (including two diagnostics that need justified *suppressions* rather than fixes) are in
>   a comment on #108.
>   - **CA2101 in `RustPtySession.cs` must not be "fixed"**: the `[MarshalAs(LPUTF8Str)]`
>     it objects to is deliberate per #152; following the analyzer reintroduces that bug.
>   - **A build that fails reads as zero warnings.** `McpServer.Tests` measured clean only
>     because the #211 lock stopped it building; clearing the lock surfaced 4 real

>
> Next on the §7 slate: nothing quick remains. The open items are the P2 perf work (`#165`,

## 2. Act on these first

### #104 — SFTP recursive download path traversal · **P0, Critical**

The only issue here with a remote-attacker-controlled arbitrary file write.

`src/Ntilde.App/native/rusty_ssh/src/lib.rs:1990-2000`

```rust
let file_name = entry.file_name();          // untrusted: from the server's read_dir
let local_child = local_dir.join(&file_name);
```

No `..` rejection, no separator check, no absolute-path check, no containment
test. `Path::join` with an absolute component *replaces* the base outright, so
`C:\...` (Windows) or `/etc/...` (Unix) escapes completely; `..\..\evil.exe`
escapes relatively. Worse, an escaped directory `local_child` is pushed back
onto `pending`, so a whole subtree can be written outside the chosen root.

Verified there is no mitigation anywhere on the path: the file's only
`canonicalize` calls are `sftp.canonicalize(".")` at `:1798` and `:1935` (remote
home expansion), and there are zero occurrences of `sanitiz`, `components()`,
`ParentDir`, or `starts_with(local_root)`. The managed side does not guard
either — `NativeSftpTransferModels.cs` contains no `..`, `GetFullPath`, or
`StartsWith`.

Secondary, lower severity: `remote_basename` (`:2287-2296`) →
`normalize_remote_directory_path` (`:2344-2358`) trims whitespace and trailing
`/` and rejects only exactly `"."` — **not** `..`. So a user remote path ending
in `/..` yields basename `".."`, and `:1749` does
`PathBuf::from(&transfer.local_path).join(remote_basename(...)?)`, relocating
the download root one level up. Input is user-supplied rather than
server-supplied, so this is hygiene rather than a vuln.

**Recommendation:** fix as written in the issue. Ship with #144 — same
function family, same native rebuild, one review.

### #144 — SFTP partial download leaves a truncated file · **P1, High**

`lib.rs:1873-1875` still writes straight to the final destination:

```rust
let mut local_file = TokioFile::create(local_path).await
    .map_err(|error| map_local_transfer_error(local_path, error))?;
```

Zero occurrences of `.part`, no `tokio::fs::rename`, no `remove_file` on any
error path. Note the aggravating detail the issue does not mention: `create`
**truncates an existing file** before any bytes arrive, so a cancelled
re-download destroys the previously good local copy. That raises this from
"leaves junk" to "silent data loss".

**Recommendation:** temp-then-rename, bundled into the #104 PR.

### #121 — Native SSH hardening · **P1, but 3 of 4 items are already done**

| Item | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| (a) No secret zeroization | **VALID** | `rusty_ssh/Cargo.toml` (19 lines) has no `zeroize`; it appears only transitively in `Cargo.lock`. Passwords are plain `String`: `lib.rs:289`, `:369`, `:2838-2845`, `:2868-2874`, plus extra `.clone()` copies at `:1524`, `:1593`. |
| (b) Raw `IntPtr`, no SafeHandle | **FIXED** | `Platform/Ssh/Native/NativeSshSafeHandle.cs` defines `NovaSshSafeHandle : SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid`; every session P/Invoke at `NativeSshInterop.cs:956-988` takes it. |
| (c) FFI error-string ownership unaudited | **FIXED** | `lib.rs:128` `static OUTSTANDING_FFI_STRINGS: AtomicI64`, inc at `:136`, dec in `nova_ssh_string_free` `:1098-1102`; managed side frees in `finally` (`NativeSshInterop.cs:207-210`, `:288-291`, `:776-792`); `alloc_balance_tests` at `:3725-3738`. |
| (d) `ffi_contract.rs` thin; `cargo test` not in CI | ~~**PARTLY FIXED**~~ → **FIXED** | CI *does* run it — `ci.yml:43-60` `rust-ffi-tests` job runs `cargo test` for both crates. **Correction (07-29): this row was wrong.** It claimed call-after-close, double-close, and concurrent poll+close were "still missing" — all three already exist in the `handle_abuse_tests` module in `lib.rs` (`calls_after_close_fail_closed` covering 5 exports, `double_close_is_rejected`, `concurrent_poll_and_close_never_crashes` at 200 iterations). The triage measured only `tests/ffi_contract.rs` and missed that module. Two genuine gaps (two racing closers; handle-id non-reuse) were closed in PR #212. |

**Recommendation:** ~~re-scope to "(a) zeroize + (d) three concurrency abuse
tests"~~. Effort drops from M to S. Close out (b) and (c) in the issue body so the
scope doesn't get re-litigated.

> **Update 07-29 (PR #212):** (a) done for the Rust-owned copies —
> `TransferAuthConfig::password` is `Zeroizing`, the two `password.clone()` calls
> became a single `take`, and the raw JSON response payloads (which carry the secret
> in cleartext pre-parse) are wiped too. (d) needed almost nothing; see the corrected
> row above. **What actually remains on #121 is the C# half of (a)** — managed
> `string` retention — which is the larger piece: Rust can only wipe what Rust owns,
> and the credential also lives in a managed string, a JSON buffer, the marshalled
> native string, and russh's protocol buffers. #212 shortens retention; it does not
> remove credentials from process memory.

### #164 — Row metadata lifecycle · **P1, High, but half is done**

| Item | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. ICH/DCH/insert-mode don't shift side-tables | **VALID** | `WritePath.cs:568-590` and `:603-651` shift only `row.Cells[c]`; no `SetExtendedText`/`SetHyperlink` in either method. `TerminalRow._extendedText`/`_hyperlinks` (`TerminalRow.cs:18-19`) stay keyed to pre-shift columns. |
| 2a. Reflow drops hyperlinks | **VALID** | `ReflowEngine.cs:61` still a 2-field tuple `(TerminalCell Cell, string? ExtendedText)`; populated `:351,:371,:387,:399`, replayed `:547-550`. Ironic consequence: the engine *reads* hyperlinks in (`:123`) and *writes* them out (`:606`), but nothing ever populates the flowed rows, so `GetHyperlinkMap()` is always null there. |
| 2b. `AppendRow(cells)` drops IsWrapped + maps | **FIXED** | All four call sites now pass wrap + both maps: `ResizeAndReflow.cs:106-110`, `:311-315`, `ReflowEngine.cs:602-606`, `WritePath.cs:421-425`. Height-grow restores via `TryPopLastRow(..., out extendedText, out hyperlinks)` + `TerminalRow.RestoreSideTables` (`:86-90`). |
| 3. `TryPopLastRow` leaves stale maps | **FIXED** | `ScrollbackPages.cs:283-289` now calls `page.ClearRowMetadata(rowIndex)`; `TerminalPage.cs:209-214` resets wrap + both arrays. |
| 4. Scrollback read side never surfaces metadata | **VALID** | `ThreadingAndInvalidation.cs:717` `Text = null, // TODO Step 5`. `AccessAndSnapshot.cs:87-91` `GetGraphemeAbsolute` degrades to `.Character.ToString()`; feeds `SelectionState.cs:97` (copy) and `Links/RowTextExtractor.cs:31` (link detection). `RenderCellSnapshot` (`RenderSnapshots.cs:98-99`) has no hyperlink field at all. |

Item 1 is the one that produces *visibly wrong output* — after `CSI @` / `CSI P`
on a line with emoji/CJK/OSC-8, cells carry `HasExtendedText` while their
strings stay at old columns. Insert mode hits it on every printable char.

**Recommendation:** re-scope to items 1, 2a, 4 and treat as one "row metadata
lifecycle" workstream. Item 4 is the shared prerequisite for #95 gap 1 — do
them together.

> **Update 07-30 (PR #225):** item 1 done — `TerminalRow.ShiftRowMetadata` moves both
> side tables with the cells for ICH, DCH and insert mode. #164 stays open for 2a and 4.
>
> Three findings worth carrying forward:
>
> - **Stale side-table entries are invisible through the rendered accessors.**
>   `GetGrapheme`/`GetGraphemeAbsolute` only consult the map when the cell carries
>   `HasExtendedText`, so a stale entry shows nothing until some later write sets that
>   flag on the same column. Four of my drop-case tests passed against the *unfixed*
>   code because of this — they were asserting through `GetGrapheme`. Anything testing
>   metadata lifecycle has to read the map directly (`GetRowAbsolute(row).GetExtendedText(col)`).
>   Expect the same trap on items 2a and 4.
> - **The maps must go back to `null`, not to an empty map.** `HasRowMetadata` is the
>   write path's fast-path guard; an empty-but-present map makes it permanently true for
>   that row and silently reintroduces per-character work in insert mode.
> - **`CommandAssistLayoutTests.TerminalPane_WhenRemotePromptSettlesLowOnShortPane_ResumesConservativeAssistLayout`
>   fails locally on clean `main`** (verified in a fresh worktree at `ef02e93`) while CI is
>   green — so it is environment-dependent, not a regression. Don't chase it as collateral
>   damage from an unrelated branch. `StressTests.DataFlood_Backpressure_StressTest` is
>   separately flaky under full-suite load and passes in isolation.

> **Update 07-30 (PR #226):** item 2a done, plus two siblings found while doing it. The reflow
> engine's logical-cell tuple now carries `Hyperlink`; the alt-screen resize and
> `ResizeDetachedScreenBufferNoLock` now copy side tables via `TerminalRow.CopyRowMetadataFrom`.
>
> - **The reflow bug hid behind code that looked complete.** Hyperlinks were read *in* from
>   paged scrollback and handed *out* to the rebuilt scrollback, so both ends looked wired
>   up — the two-field tuple in the middle meant `GetHyperlinkMap()` on every flowed row was
>   unconditionally null. Read both ends of a data path, not one.
> - **Mutation-check each site separately, not the set.** I asserted the detached-buffer fix was
>   covered because a test failed with all three mutants planted. Isolating that one mutant
>   showed zero failures — the test had failed for an unrelated reason (malformed escape
>   sequences printing the OSC introducer as literal text). `ResizeDetachedScreenBufferNoLock`
>   is likely **unreachable**: it only runs if `_mainScreen` geometry is stale leaving the alt
>   screen, and the background resize keeps it in step. Worth deleting on its own.
> - **The trailing-content trim has a cursor-row rescue clause that masks metadata bugs.**
>   `if (i == absCursorPhysicalIdx && _cursorCol > validLen) validLen = _cursorCol;` — so a
>   test that writes content and immediately resizes tests the *protected* path. Move off the
>   row with a newline. This cost me a second false pass, on the review fix for linked
>   trailing spaces.

> **Update 07-30 (PR #227):** item 4 done — the paged-scrollback render builder had
> `Text = null, // TODO Step 5`, so extended graphemes were *drawn* as their first UTF-16 code
> unit after scrolling off, even though #95 gap 1 had already made copy/selection correct. The
> screen and the clipboard disagreed. **#164 closed.**
>
> Deliberate non-change: `RenderCellSnapshot` has no hyperlink field and doesn't need one — hover
> and click resolve links live via `GetHyperlinkAbsolute` (`TerminalView.cs:1937, :2027`). Only a
> persistent link-underline feature would need it.

### #107 — RustPtySession · **P1, High**

All three items valid, and the read-error one is worse than described.

- **(a)** `RustPtySession.cs:585-590` — negative `pty_read` just does
  `_utf8Decoder.Reset(); Thread.Sleep(50);`. No code inspection, no log, no
  exit notification, no loop exit. A permanently failing handle spins at 20 Hz
  **forever** with the user seeing a frozen tab and no error. Contrast the
  `read == 0` EOF branch at `:580-584`, which correctly breaks.
- **(b)** `:408-435` — discarded `Task.Delay(300).ContinueWith(...)`, no
  cancellation tied to `_cts`, failure path is `Console.WriteLine` (`:433`).
  Zero `File.Delete` in the file, so **every PowerShell session permanently
  leaks a `ntilde_init_{guid}.ps1` into `%TEMP%`**. (Aside: the script writes a
  hardcoded fake "Windows PowerShell / Copyright (C) Microsoft" banner plus
  `Clear-Host` at `:416-422` — worth a second look on its own merits.)
- **(c)** 18 `Console.WriteLine` remain, none routed through `AppLogger`.

**Recommendation:** (a) and (b) are small and independently shippable. Do them
before any of the P2 perf work. (c) folds into #109.

> **Update 07-29 (PR #214, merged `5c8e98a`):** (a) and (b) done. #107 stays open for
> (c) only, which cannot be fixed in place: `Ntilde.Pty` is barred from
> referencing VT (where `TerminalLogger` lives) by `LayeringTests`
> `.Pty_must_not_depend_on_Vt`, so routing this file's `Console.WriteLine` calls needs
> a logging abstraction #109 must design.
>
> Two findings from doing the work:
> - **`pty_read` collapses every failure to `-1`** (null args, read error with errno
>   discarded, poisoned lock, caught panic), so the issue's "treat distinct negative
>   codes as terminal" is not achievable until #120 adds `pty_last_error`. The fix
>   bounds the retry instead.
> - **PTY injection timing is load-bearing for an unrelated test.** Switching the init
>   script write to `WriteAllTextAsync` moved the injected keystrokes later and broke
>   `PtySmokeTests.AgentSentInput_IsByteFaithful`. The synchronous write is deliberate.
>
> ~~Neither exit-code path is directly tested — `Native.pty_read` is a static P/Invoke
> with no seam. Making it injectable is a worthwhile follow-up.~~ **Done in PR #215
> (`df7ab1e`):** the read call is injectable via an internal constructor, and all four
> paths are covered (bounded retry, failure exit code, session teardown, EOF still 0,
> counter reset). Mutation-verified — disabling the bound fails exactly the two
> bound-dependent tests.
>
> That work also surfaced a general hazard in this class: **the read/process loops start
> inside the constructor**, so anything subscribing to a `RustPtySession` event can miss
> an exit that fires first. The test helper had to consult `ExitCode` as well as `OnExit`;
> the existing buffered-output replay exists for the same reason on the output path.

### #120 — PTY Unix path · **P1, and item 1 is already fixed**

| Item | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. `LC_ALL=C`/`LANG=C` forced | **FIXED** (via #153) | `native/src/lib.rs:402-419` now probes `LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE`/`LANG` and only supplies `C.UTF-8` (or `LC_CTYPE=UTF-8` on macOS) when none is set. |
| 2. Child not killed on close | **PARTLY** | `pty_close` (`:686-712`) closes `HPCON`/`h_process` only, comment says "Drop logic handles the rest". The `child.kill()` lives in a *different* export, `pty_cancel_read` (`:677-681`). The normal path is safe (`RustPtySession.Dispose` calls `pty_cancel_read` at `:735` before `pty_close` at `:758-760`), but the `:726` branch deliberately skips cancel while unwinding — so orphaning is reachable on the exception path. |
| 3. No error reporting channel | **VALID** | `pty_spawn_impl` returns `null_mut()` at `:313, 378, 428, 433, 437`, discarding via `Err(_) =>`. No `pty_last_error` export exists. |
| 4. Windows handle leaks (minor) | **VALID + worse** | Three leak paths in `win32::spawn_with_passthrough`: `:53-55` (2nd `CreatePipe` fails → first pipe's 2 handles leak), `:69-71` (`CreatePseudoConsole` fails → all 4 leak), `:154-159` (`CreateProcessW` fails → `h_out_read` + `h_in_write` leak). Also unchecked: `InitializeProcThreadAttributeList` (`:81, :84`) and `UpdateProcThreadAttribute` (`:86-94`) return values ignored, and `DeleteProcThreadAttributeList` is **not** called on the success path (only in the failure branch at `:157`).

**Recommendation:** re-scope to items 2–4; item 3 is the user-visible one
("binary not found" is currently indistinguishable from "openpty failed").
Item 4 grew — add the unchecked-return and success-path-leak findings.

> **Update 07-30 (PRs #228, #229): #120 CLOSED.** Item 4 in #228 (RAII drop guards for
> handles/HPCON/attribute list, checked returns, `DeleteProcThreadAttributeList` on the
> success path). Items 2 and 3 in #229 (`pty_close` kills the child; new `pty_last_error`
> thread-local channel). Item 1 was already #153.
>
> Findings worth carrying:
>
> - **`Rust FFI Tests` ran on ubuntu only, and all of `rusty_pty`'s ConPTY code is
>   `#[cfg(windows)]`.** So its Windows tests — including the pre-existing
>   `cancel_read_unblocks_a_pending_read`, the #119 Dispose-join guard — were compiled out
>   and never ran in CI. Now a Linux + Windows matrix. **Check the OS matrix before
>   trusting a "the tests cover it" claim on platform-gated code.**
> - **Item 2 is unobservable on Windows.** Dropping the ConPTY master closes the

## 3. Close or re-scope

### #166 — ImageRegistry · **CLOSE AS OBSOLETE**

`src/Ntilde.Rendering/ImageRegistry.cs` no longer exists. Zero matches for
`ImageRegistry`, `RegisterImage`, or `GetImage` anywhere in `src/`.
`git log` on the path: `6ccd926 refactor(rendering): remove dead ImageRegistry (#176)`.

The use-after-dispose was resolved by deletion rather than by fixing the
disposal design. (Copies survive only in detached worktrees such as
`.claude/worktrees/feat-velopack/`, which are not on `main`.) Note the
`RowImageCache` the issue cites as the good example is also gone; only
`RowCache.cs` remains.

### #81 — CI testhost teardown hang · **RE-SCOPE, effectively resolved**

The original symptom is contained. `ci.yml:284` now runs
`--blame-hang-timeout 5m --blame-hang-dump-type mini` (not `8m`), the step is
`continue-on-error: true` (`:277`), and `:287-297` uploads `**/*.dmp` on
`if: always()`. The 8-line comment at `:266-275` records that the root cause was
dump-confirmed as a framework deadlock in `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` 12.0.4
(`Directory.Packages.props:14`), tracked upstream as `AvaloniaUI/Avalonia#21467`,
and that collection serialization, `maxParallelThreads:1`, and
`ThreadPool.SetMinThreads` were each ruled out with dump evidence.

`8m` survives only in non-gating jobs, all with `--blame-hang-dump-type none`
(golden-PNG `:350`, replay `:410`, pty-smoke `:481`, render-metrics `:576`,
tab-perf `:634`, nightly-stress `:692`).

**Recommendation:** close #81 and fold the only remaining action —
"re-gate headless App.Tests once Avalonia#21467 ships" — into #117, which
already owns that item. Two issues currently track the same waiting-on-upstream
task.

### #109 — Logging · **RE-SCOPE, two of four items already fixed**

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `TerminalLogger` is a 6-line `Action<string>` with no levels | **FIXED.** `VT/TerminalLogger.cs`, 55 LOC: `LogLevel` enum (`:5-11`), `MinimumLevel` filter (`:23, :29`), structured `Action<LogLevel,string>? OnLogLevel` (`:20`), `Debug/Info/Warning/Error` helpers (`:50-53`). The bare `Action<string>` survives only as back-compat with a `[LEVEL]` prefix (`:42`). |
| `File.AppendAllText("error.log", …)` in the draw path | **FIXED.** No hardcoded `"error.log"` anywhere. Only 2 `AppendAllText` calls in `src/`, both to structured paths: `AppLogger.cs:35`, `WorkspaceManager.cs:448`. |
| 28 `Console.WriteLine` in src | **PARTLY.** Now 34 across 9 files, but 6 are in `Conformance/VtConformanceReportTool.cs` (a console tool — legitimate). The real smell is `RustPtySession.cs` (18) plus GUI-side strays in `ThemeManager.cs` (3), `MainWindow.axaml.cs` (2), `OpenSshSession.cs`, `NativeSshSession.cs`, `ReplayWindow.axaml.cs`, `ReplayViewModel.cs`, `PtyRecorder.cs`. |
| 26 empty/silent catch blocks | **UNDERSTATED.** ~79 total: **41** truly empty across 19 files, plus 38 comment-only across 26 files. Heaviest: `NativeSshInterop.cs` (11), `NativePortForwardSession.cs` (6), `MainWindow.axaml.cs` (3). |

**Recommendation:** re-scope to "route the 28 non-tool `Console.WriteLine` calls
through `TerminalLogger`/`AppLogger`, and audit the 41 empty catches". Merge the
`RustPtySession` half with #107(c) so one PR covers that file.

### #115 — SSH consolidation · **RE-SCOPE, second claim not supported**

Assembly sprawl confirmed: no `Ntilde.Ssh` project exists (the 10 projects
are Cli, Conformance, Rendering, Replay, VT, Platform, Pty, AgentHost.Contracts,
McpServer, App). SSH lives in `Platform/Ssh/` (37 files across 8 subfolders) plus
`App/Services/Ssh/` (10), `App/ViewModels/Ssh/` (6), `App/Views/Ssh/` (4), and
`App/Shell/{SshAskPassCommand,SftpService,VaultService}.cs`. (There is no
`App/Shell/Ssh/` subdirectory, contra the issue's Area line.)

But the "two owners of the same edit flow" claim **does not hold**.
`ConnectionManager.axaml.cs` (654 LOC, as stated) is list + read-only detail
rendering: `RenderDetail` (`:372`) writes display-only fields (`:381-382`,
`:407-409`) and delegates editing outward via
`public event Action<TerminalProfile>? OnEditProfile` (`:29`, raised `:467`),
which `MainWindow.axaml.cs:4825-4827` routes to
`ShowNewSshConnectionDialogAsync(profile)` → `new NewSshConnectionView(vm)`
(`:5076`). `NewSshConnectionViewModel` (596 LOC) is the sole owner of the mapping
(`ToSshProfile()` `:296`, `ApplySshProfile()` `:394`). They share
`SshProfileRowViewModel`/`TerminalProfile`, not editing logic.

**Recommendation:** drop item 2, keep item 1 (assembly consolidation). Priority
stays P3 — this is tidiness, not risk.

### #112 — DI · **RE-SCOPE, partially landed and the named type is wrong**

- A minimal hand-rolled composition root **does** exist:
  `App/Shell/AppServiceBundle.cs:3` (`record AppServiceBundle(StartupOrchestrator Startup)`)
  and `App/Shell/AppServices.cs:7-31`, injected via
  `MainWindow(AppServiceBundle services)` (`:1934`) — but it carries exactly one
  dependency.
- `MainWindow` still `new`s its services inline (`:1942-1946`:
  `CommandPaletteUsageStore`, `SshConnectionService`, `SshInteractionService`,
  `SshLegacyProfileMigrationService`; plus `TerminalSettings.Load()` at `:1940`
  and statics `AgentHostService.Instance`, `AgentSessionRegistry.Instance`,
  `SftpService.Instance`, `ActiveSshSessionRegistry.Instance`).
- **`GlobalCommandRegistry` does not exist.** The type is `CommandRegistry`
  (`App/Shell/CommandRegistry.cs:18-20`) — still a mutable, non-thread-safe
  static whose `GetCommands()` (`:36`) hands out the live internal list.
  MainWindow calls `Clear()` then ~120 `Register(...)` on every settings or
  shortcut change (`:4254-4374+`).
- `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` is used in exactly one place in
  `src/`: `McpServer/Program.cs:1, 16, 20`.

**Recommendation:** rename the referenced type in the issue body (otherwise the
next person greps for a symbol that doesn't exist), note the `AppServiceBundle`
starting point, and re-scope to "widen `AppServiceBundle`; make `CommandRegistry`
instance-scoped".

### #114 — CommandAssist · **RE-SCOPE, flag count halved**

Assembly extraction still pending: 62 `.cs` files, **4,766 LOC** (matching the
issue), still under `App/CommandAssist/`. `CommandAssistController.cs` is **959
LOC** (also matching).

The state-machine claim is now overstated: `:15-26` has **7** bool fields, not
~12 (`_isAltScreenActive`, `_isRemote`, `_isShellIntegrationEnabled`,
`_hasObservedShellIntegrationMarker`,
`_hasObservedStructuredCommandCaptureMarker`, `_ignoreCurrentSubmission`,
`_isExplicitAssistSession`). A `CommandAssistMode` enum and
`CommandAssistModeRouter` already exist, so *mode* is enum-driven; what remains
boolean is the session/marker lifecycle (see the implicit state machine in
`IsStructuredShellIntegrationActive()` `:889`).

### #110 — MainWindow extraction · **RE-SCOPE, one claim unsupported**

MainWindow is **5,826 LOC** — it has *grown* since the issue was filed (5,297).
`TabManagerService` / `PaneLayoutService` do not exist; all tab/pane/MRU/zoom/
broadcast state is inline (fields at `:60-70`).

The "`_tabMru`/`_broadcastEnabledTabs` mutated both directly and from
`Dispatcher.UIThread.Post`" claim is **not supported**. Both are mutated only
from synchronous UI-thread paths (`TouchTabMru`/`CleanupTabMru` `:375-392` via
`SwitchTabByMru` `:399, :407`; the `tabs.SelectionChanged` handler body `:2060`,
*not* inside a `Post`; `AddTab` `:3859`; `InitializeRestoredTabs` `:2476`). The
nearby `Post` at `:355-373` mutates `_pendingVisualRefreshTabs`, a different
collection. The underlying smell (plain `List`/`HashSet`, no thread-affinity
assertion) stands; the specific race does not.

`_isDraggingTransferOverlay` **is** still guard-without-`try/finally` (set `:4931`,
cleared `:4960`/`:4970`); mitigated in practice by the `PointerCaptureLost`
handler.

### #91 — Installer · **RE-SCOPE, adjacent work landed**

No Velopack, MSI/MSIX/NSIS, `.deb`/`.rpm`, `.dmg`/`.pkg`, `signtool`, `codesign`,
`notarytool`, or Trusted Signing step anywhere in `release.yml` — still portable
zip only (`:225-233`, uploaded `:235-239`, for `win-x64`/`linux-x64`/`osx-arm64`
`:193-199`). macOS builds will be Gatekeeper-quarantined.

Two things landed since filing that the issue should reference: a `submit_winget`
job (`:249-268`, `wingetcreate` PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, gated on a
`WINGET_PAT` secret and self-skipping if unset) and a `release_tests` gate
(`:128-183`, `fail-fast: true`, three OSes, `#156` — releases used to publish AOT
bundles without running any test). `publish_aot` now depends on it (`:189`).

## 4. Notable corrections to issue bodies

Worth fixing in place so future readers aren't misled:

- **#172(a)** — `Skew` is genuinely never applied (`GlyphCache.cs:140-143` builds
  `physFont` with no `SkewX`), but it currently **cannot produce wrong output**:
  `SkewX` is never *set* anywhere in `src` (the only repo-wide hit is the read at
  `GlyphCache.cs:79`, so it is always `0.0`), and italics bypass the atlas
  entirely — `TerminalDrawOperation.cs:1279` `if (_glyphCache != null && !runIsItalic)`.
  This is latent/dead-weight, not a live rendering bug. Severity down.
- **#172(c)** — the missing ranges are real (`GlyphCache.cs:126-134` covers only
  `1F300-1FAFF` and `2600-27BF`), but flags and ZWJ sequences are rescued by a
  *different* mechanism: `ContainsRunesRequiringComplexShaping`
  (`TerminalDrawOperation.cs:1834-1849`) routes `1F300-1FAFF`, regional
  indicators (`:1890-1891`), `2600-27BF`, and ZWJ `200D` to the HarfBuzz path
  (`:1270`) when `_enableComplexShaping` is true (the default,
  `TerminalView.cs:549`). Genuinely uncovered by *both* lists: `2B50`, bare
  `FE0F`, `20E3`, `1F000-1F2FF`, `2B00-2BFF`. With `EnableComplexShaping=false`
  the narrow ranges become the sole gate.
- **#172(b)** is the one with real user-visible impact and it is *harder* than
  written: `GlyphAtlas.cs:97` hard-clips with `canvas.ClipRect(rect)` sized to
  advance × (ascent+descent), and the consumer at
  `TerminalDrawOperation.cs:1294/:1453` positions blits assuming exactly that
  packing. Fixing it requires storing per-glyph bearings and updating the blit
  math, not just switching to the `MeasureText(text, out SKRect)` overload.
- **#126** — confirmed at `TerminalView.cs:77` (530 ms,
  `DispatcherPriority.Render`) and `:330-344` (unconditional `_isDirty = true` →
  plain `InvalidateVisual()` at `:326`). The strongest argument for the fix isn't
  in the issue: `ShouldRunUiTimers()` (`:1464-1471`) checks visibility but never
  focus, while `Render` already does `bool hideCursor = !IsKeyboardFocusWithin;`
  (`:1512`) — so every blink frame on an unfocused pane is **provably** wasted
  work. No reduced-motion setting exists anywhere in `src` (only the
  all-or-nothing `settings.CursorBlink`, `:678`).
- **#127** — worse than "not covered": `Ntilde.Benchmarks.csproj:13` has a
  single project reference (`Ntilde.VT`), so the benchmark assembly
  **cannot see** `Ntilde.Rendering` at all. All 6 existing `[Benchmark]`
  methods are parser/reflow/scrollback. And the metrics the issue assumes exist
  partly don't: `RendererStatistics` has raw `RowCacheHits`/`RowCacheMisses`
  (`:59-60`) but **no glyph cache hit/miss counters at all** (only
  `GlyphAtlasResets` `:100`) and no computed `HitRate` property. Item 2 needs a
  metrics-plumbing prerequisite.
- **#173** — every sub-item confirmed. Two details worth adding: the
  `BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` retry is a **three**-copy path, not two (`peek_event` clone
  `:524-535` → `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` → managed `buffer[..payloadLength]`
  slice at `NativeSshInterop.cs:324-326`), and `NativePortForwardSession.cs:97`
  is a lone synchronous `channel.Stream.Write` in a file that already uses async
  writes at `:426` and `:482` — so it looks like an oversight, not a design
  choice, and should be a cheap fix.
- **#165** — the LINQ boxing is **partly** mitigated: `WritePath.cs:163-172` now
  short-circuits `grapheme.Length == 1` with `Rune.TryCreate`, so
  `EnumerateRunes().FirstOrDefault(...)` only runs for multi-char graphemes. The
  per-grapheme `string` from `GetTextElement()` (`:150-154`) still allocates for
  **every** char including plain ASCII, and `IsLastRuneZwj` (`:381-390`) still
  re-enumerates on every write (`:366`, `:272`). Additional finding not in the
  issue: `Write(string)` at `ResizeAndReflow.cs:18-21` loops `WriteCharCore(c)`,
  which does `grapheme = c.ToString()` (`WritePath.cs:61`) — a *second*
  per-char allocation on that path.

- **#102** — sharper numbers. `TerminalPane.axaml.cs`: 10 Parser `+=` / 0 `-=`;
  ~24 TerminalView `+=` / 2 `-=`. `Dispose()` (`:2349-2355`) →
  `DetachFromUiThread()` (`:2366-2401`) removes 3 of ~34 registrations.
  `_statusTimer` is stopped (`:2389-2390`) but its `Tick` lambda (`:467`) is
  never detached; `_shellLifecycleTracker.EventObserved` (`:2688`) has no `-=`.
  MainWindow: `_recordingToastTimer.Stop()` **is** called in `OnClosing`
  (`:5506-5517`) — that sub-claim is fixed — but the `Tick`/`Loaded`/`Activated`/
  `SizeChanged` lambdas are still never unsubscribed. TerminalView timers are
  **fine**: `OnDetachedFromVisualTree` (`:788-793`) → `StopUiTimers()`
  (`:1451-1462`) stops all five, and both timers use the ctor-callback overload
  so there are no lambdas to leak.

  > **Update 07-30 (PR #230): #102 CLOSED — the raw `+=` / `-=` counts above are
  > misleading, which is the lesson.** A missing `-=` only matters when the target
  > outlives the subscriber. Sorting the ~34 registrations by target lifetime:

  > - **TermView (~24)** — the pane's own XAML child (`TerminalPane.axaml:50`), dies

  > - **`_statusTimer.Tick`** — timer is stopped *and nulled*, so the lambda goes with it.

  > - **`SftpService.Instance.JobUpdated`** — the *only* cross-lifetime subscription,
  >   and it is removed.
  >
  > So "3 of ~34 removed" was true and irrelevant. **Count subscriptions whose target

- **#182** — confirmed dead at `TerminalView.cs:459-467` (message read for
  truthiness, then silent `return`). Both `DropRouter` block branches
  (`DropRouter.cs:24-29` secure-input, `:64-68` metacharacters) are swallowed.
  Additional finding: the third producer at `:84` ("WSL path mapping failed")
  sets `TextToSend`, so it falls through to `:481` and is *also* never shown —
  so three messages are dead, not two. No suitable channel exists: none of
  TerminalView's 11 public events carries a message, and MainWindow's only toast
  (`ShowRecordingToast`, `:5756`) is recording-specific.
- **#174** — all valid, and the cache-key drift is concrete: `setup-dotnet` uses
  floating `"10.0.x"` (`ci.yml:134, 190, 320, 386, 459, 552, 610, 668, 736`;
  `release.yml:146, 208`) while cache keys hardcode a non-matching
  `dotnet-sdk-${{ runner.os }}-10.0.300` (`ci.yml:126, 182, 312, 378, 450, 543,
  602, 660, 728`). `ci/run.ps1`/`run.sh` use bare `dotnet` throughout
  (`:5,10,13,16,19,22,25[,32]`) and never call `scripts/build.*` — the exact
  daemon-hang hazard `Directory.Build.props:10-13` documents. They also pass
  `-warnaserror` (`:16` in both) which GH CI does not (`ci.yml:142`), so there
  are two divergent build contracts.
- **#117** — `coverlet.collector` 6.0.4 is already pinned
  (`Directory.Packages.props:29`) and referenced by all 5 test projects, but no
  `dotnet test` passes `--collect` and no coverage artifact or gate exists: the
  dependency is present and entirely unused. The headless suppression is
  `continue-on-error: true` (`ci.yml:277`), and App.Tests is excluded from the
  gating lane (`:252-264`) altogether.
- **#95** — all six checked gaps confirmed, including gap 1
  (`AccessAndSnapshot.cs:106-110` returns `null` for scrollback) with the
  storage side already present (`ScrollbackPages.cs:222-226`,
  `TerminalPage.cs:184-190`). Gap 2: `AnsiParser.cs:1584-1592` keeps only the
  URI. Bonus finding — a malformed `OSC 8;URI` with no second `;` is silently
  ignored rather than treated as a close. Gap 3:
  `TerminalView.cs:1822-1832` passes `(absRow, col, col, osc8)` while the
  auto-detect path passes a real span (`:1852`). Gap 4: 4 schemes at
  `Links/LinkSchemes.cs:12-13`. Gap 6: zero `Hyperlink|Uri|Link` occurrences in
  either `RenderSnapshots.cs` or `ReplayModels.cs`.
- **#113** — TerminalView 2,103 LOC, TerminalDrawOperation 2,755 LOC, both still
  in `App/Shell/` under `namespace Ntilde.Shell`. Blocker the issue omits:
  `Ntilde.Rendering.csproj` references only `Ntilde.VT` + SkiaSharp —
  **no Avalonia** — while both files depend on `Avalonia`, `Avalonia.Media`,
  `Avalonia.Platform`, `Avalonia.Rendering.SceneGraph`, `Avalonia.Skia`
  (`TerminalDrawOperation.cs:1-5`). A straight move is impossible without either
  adding Avalonia to Rendering (defeating the boundary) or first splitting out a
  Skia-only core. Re-estimate accordingly.
- **#111** — confirmed and slightly worse: no `ThemeService`/`SettingsApplier`
  exists (`ThemeManager.cs` only loads definitions). `ApplyThemeToUI()` (`:4153`)
  is called from 6 sites (`:2086, 4370, 4371, 4994, 5001, 5012, 5037, 5064`), and
  each live-preview handler (`:4994-5015`) hand-rolls a *different* combination
  of `ApplyThemeToUI` / `ApplySettingsToAllTabs` / `UpdateTransparencyHints` /
  `UpdateTabVisuals` — the drift is already present. `_settings = sw.Settings`
  wholesale swap still happens (`:5019-5029`). Partial mitigation since filing: a
  `previewSnapshot` + Cancel revert path (`:4981-4991`, `:5053-5067`) for #167 —
  which addresses preview leakage, not the reference swap.
- **#96** — nothing exists yet, confirmed. The only key-adjacent code is
  identity-file *selection* (`NativeSshConnectionOptions.IdentityFilePath` →
  `load_secret_key`, `rusty_ssh/src/lib.rs:2865-2876`). Note
  `SettingsWindow.axaml:718` has an `SshKeyPathInput` TextBox with
  `IsEnabled="False"` — a disabled placeholder that should either be wired up or
  removed as part of this.
- **#108** — confirmed off (`Directory.Build.props:61`) with a 34-line rationale
  comment (`:27-60`) enumerating the ~350 hits: CA1834 (500+, "the bulk comes
  from a single file"), CA1865/CA1866, CA1051 (46), CA1305/CA1310/CA1304/CA1311,
  CA1861, CS8602 (5 in TerminalPane), CS0618 (SkiaSharp).

## 5. Dependency clusters

Sequencing that avoids rework:

1. **Rust SFTP** — #104 → #144. Same functions, one native rebuild, one security
   review.
2. **Row metadata + hyperlinks** — #164 item 4 (scrollback read path) unblocks
   #95 gap 1. #164 item 2a (reflow carries hyperlinks) and #95 gap 2 (`id=`
   param) both change the side-table value type, so doing them separately means
   touching `ReflowEngine` twice. Do #164 (1, 2a, 4) then #95 (1, 2, 3).
3. **Pty logging** — #107(c) and #109's `RustPtySession` share one file. One PR.
4. **Build hygiene** — #174 must land before #108: `.editorconfig` is where the
   per-rule suppressions live, so re-enabling `TreatWarningsAsErrors` without it
   forces a global `NoWarn` list that #108 explicitly wants to avoid.
5. **CI hardening** — #117 absorbs #81's remaining item. #127 needs a
   `RendererStatistics` glyph-counter prerequisite plus a project reference from
   the benchmarks csproj.
6. **App refactors** — #112 (DI + instance-scoped `CommandRegistry`) is the
   stated prerequisite for #110/#111/#114. #113 needs an Avalonia/Skia split
   decided first. Treat the whole cluster as one program, not five issues.

## 6. Quick wins

Small, independent, verified-valid, each shippable in under a day:

| # | Why it's cheap |
|---|---|
| ~~166~~ | ~~Close it. File is gone.~~ **Done 07-29.** |
| ~~81~~ | ~~Close it. Fold the one live item into #117.~~ **Done 07-29.** |
| 174 | Add `global.json` + `.editorconfig`, fix 9 cache keys, point `ci/run.*` at the wrappers. Config only. |
| 144 | Temp-then-rename in one Rust function (and it prevents silent data loss today). |
| 95 gap 1 | Wire one `if` branch at `AccessAndSnapshot.cs:106-110` to the page accessors that already exist. The issue itself labels it "good first issue". |
| 126 | Stop the blink timer on focus loss. `Render` already hides the cursor when unfocused, so no visual change. |
| 107 (b) | Delete the temp file; await the injection task. |
| 182 | One event + one toast call. |

## 7. Suggested next-sprint slate

`#104 + #144` (one security PR) → `#121a` → `#107` → `#164 (1, 2a, 4)` →
then the quick-win batch (`#174`, `#126`, `#95 gap 1`, `#182`).
~~and close `#166` / `#81`~~ — done 2026-07-29.

Leave the refactor cluster (#110–#115) parked until #112 is scheduled
deliberately — it is the gate on the other four, and MainWindow grew 529 LOC
while those five issues sat open.
