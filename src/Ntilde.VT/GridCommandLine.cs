    /// <param name="Text">
    /// The extracted text. Soft-wrapped (auto-wrapped) rows are joined with no separator, so a

    /// <param name="CursorOffset">
    /// The cursor's index within <paramref name="Text"/>. Always in <c>[0, Text.Length]</c>: the
    /// cursor is frequently mid-line (arrow keys, <c>Ctrl+A</c>), so this is not simply the

    /// True when <paramref name="Text"/> contains a hard line break — a shell continuation
    /// entry, or a bracketed paste of several lines. <paramref name="Text"/> is then
    /// <i>raw</i>: it still contains whatever the shell painted as a
    /// continuation prompt (<c>PS2</c>, <c>PROMPT2</c>, <c>&gt;&nbsp;</c>), because nothing marks

    /// <c>InlineView</c> suggestion, fish's autosuggestion - painted past the cursor rather than as
    /// text the user typed and moved back through. The characters are still in
