    /// even knowing - the shell's mode on the main screen.

    /// (0b1). Unsupported bits (report event types, report alternate keys, report all keys,
    /// report associated text) are masked out on push/set, so they are never stored and never
    /// echoed by the CSI ? u query. This is deliberate: the spec's detection section tells
    /// applications to "set the desired progressive enhancements and then query" to discover
    /// partial implementations, which only works if the terminal reports the flags actually
    /// in effect. Echoing bits we do not honor would make crossterm/Codex believe key release
    /// events are coming when they are not.
