/// Serializes every test in this crate that creates or destroys OS handles.
///
/// Crate-level rather than per-module, and that scope is the whole point. Cargo runs tests as parallel
/// threads inside **one process**, and these tests assert on process-wide state:
///
/// - Windows reuses handle values eagerly, so after a `CloseHandle` the same numeric value can be
///   handed back to a `CreatePipe` on another thread. `is_open(closed_value)` then reports someone
///   else's live handle as ours.
/// - `GetProcessHandleCount` is perturbed by any concurrent handle activity.
///
/// A module-local lock was not enough: the spawn tests in `last_error_tests`, `close_kills_child_tests`
/// and `cancel_read_tests` all create PTYs — and therefore handles — from outside
/// `handle_ownership_tests`, so they could still reuse a value or inflate a count. Review on #238
/// caught that; the first version of this fix reduced the race instead of removing it.
///
/// Poisoning is ignored so one panicking test cannot cascade into spurious failures across the rest.
