/// default scroll position - which is the theme editor and preview, well above the TITLE BAR
/// section further down the same tab. That defeated the entry point's entire purpose (the section
/// is not independently discoverable; this menu item exists solely to reach it), hence a small,
/// general "which section" input rather than a magic string or a title-bar-only constructor
/// overload.
