    /// copy elsewhere in the heap that nothing has a reference to and nothing can clear.</item>

    /// What this does <em>not</em> do, stated plainly so nobody reads more into it: transient
    /// <see cref="string"/> copies still exist. <see cref="TryGetRuntimePassword"/> has to return one

    /// immediately, which is a materially different exposure from one that persists for the session.

    /// deliberately not bundled here.
