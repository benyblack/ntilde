/// The suggestion popup. Renders rows, and turns pointer gestures on them into the two requests the
/// pane knows how to answer: select this row, accept this row.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why events rather than commands.</strong> Accepting a row sends text to a PTY and needs the
/// grid read, the echo flag and the markless accumulator that only <c>TerminalPane</c> has - the same
/// path <c>Ctrl+Enter</c> takes. A command on the view-model would either duplicate that gate or
/// bypass it, and this assembly cannot see the session anyway. So the view reports the gesture and the
/// pane decides, which keeps exactly one insertion gate in the product.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why not a <c>ListBox</c>.</strong> A ListBox would supply hover, selection and
/// scroll-into-view for free, and would also take keyboard focus off <c>TerminalView</c> on the first
/// click - after which the user's next keystroke goes to the list instead of the shell. The popup
/// overlays a live terminal that must keep focus at all times, so the rows are deliberately
/// non-focusable <c>Border</c>s and the three behaviors are wired by hand.
