/// he typed <c>gt</c> the terminal helpfully offered <c>gti status</c> back. Capture is not the bug -

/// bash, zsh and fish; PowerShell reports 1 for an unresolved name and is indistinguishable from any
/// other failure by exit code alone, so the Fix-time recogniser's classification of the output tail
/// is threaded back through <c>CapturePipeline.MarkLastCommandInvalidAsync</c> to cover it.
