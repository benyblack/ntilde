/// <para>
/// Replaces <c>LocalCommandDocsProvider</c> (7 commands, 9 hand-written help items) and
/// <c>SeedRecipeProvider</c> (7 recipes). Those covered <c>git</c>, <c>docker</c>, <c>ls</c>,
/// <c>cd</c>, <c>grep</c>, <c>Get-ChildItem</c> and <c>Set-Location</c>; every other command in the
/// world got "No local help found", which is the shape of #250.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Ordered sources.</strong> The design doc's Pillar 5 lists three: (a) the bundled
/// catalogue, (b) local probing for an "open full help" action, (c) the Phase 5 AI seam. (a) and (b)
/// are here. (c) is deliberately absent rather than stubbed - Phase 5 adapts this class to
/// <c>IAssistContentProvider</c>, and an empty interface implemented early is a guess about a design
/// that has not been made.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Docs versus recipes.</strong> A catalogue entry is one summary line and up to six example
/// invocations. The summary is the Doc row: it answers "what is this command". The examples are the
/// Recipe rows: they answer "how do I run it", and each one is insertable, which is why the row's
/// display text *is* the command rather than a prose title. The seed provider wrote titles like
/// "Clone and switch" over a command the user could not see; a row whose text is the command it
/// inserts cannot mislead about what pressing Enter will do.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Loading is lazy and off the caller's thread.</strong> The asset is ~825 KB of JSON. It is
/// parsed on first use inside a <see cref="Task.Run"/>, never during construction: this type is
/// built at the App composition root on the startup path, and the plan's startup budget does not
/// have a JSON parse in it. Both public methods are async, so there is nowhere for the cost to leak
/// onto the UI thread.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Thread safety.</strong> One <see cref="Lazy{T}"/> with
