/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What changed in V2 Phase 4a.</strong> This class used to have three branches, two of
/// which were unreachable: both keyed off <c>CommandFailureContext.ErrorOutput</c>, and the single
/// call site in <c>TerminalPane</c> passed a hard-coded <c>null</c>. The one branch that did run
/// was an edit-distance guess against a seven-name list, published at 0.82 against a Fix threshold
/// of 0.8 - so the only thing Fix mode could ever say was "did you mean git?", and it said it on
/// the strength of no evidence about what had actually gone wrong. Phase 4a task 1 fills
/// <see cref="CommandFailureContext.OutputTail"/> from the grid, which is what makes the rest of
/// the table reachable at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The dispatch is deliberately dumb.</strong> Every recogniser is asked, in table order,
/// and the results are concatenated. There is no early exit on a match: a command-not-found on a
/// script file legitimately produces both "did you mean" and "run it with ./", and a first-match
/// rule would have to encode a priority that the confidence numbers already express better. The
/// cost is bounded - fifteen substring scans over at most 8 KB, once per failing command.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The output-tail ladder.</strong> How much the service is willing to infer scales with
/// how much it can see:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><description><em>Output captured and a recogniser matched</em> - the table's answer,
/// at the confidence the recogniser chose.</description></item>
/// <item><description><em>Output captured, nothing matched</em> - a typo correction is
/// <em>refused</em> above <see cref="CommandErrorRecognizers.Plausible"/>. The command ran, printed
/// something we do not understand, and failed; "did you mean git?" for a <c>git</c> that exists and
/// exited 1 is noise. This is the case the old 0.82 branch got wrong.</description></item>
/// <item><description><em>No output captured at all</em> (markless session, scrolled past,
/// stale mark) - the pre-Phase-4a behaviour survives unchanged, because it is all there is: a
/// correction of the first token, capped below the Fix threshold so it informs without
/// interrupting.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ordering is by confidence, then by title, so the surface's top row is the strongest claim and
/// the order is stable across runs (the popup's selected index is 0 and must not move between two
/// equally confident rows).
