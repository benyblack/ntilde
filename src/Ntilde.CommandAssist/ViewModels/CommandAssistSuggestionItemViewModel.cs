/// <strong>Why this stopped being a record (V2 Phase 3a).</strong> Selection used to be baked in at
/// construction, so moving the selection meant clearing the <c>ObservableCollection</c> and rebuilding
/// every row. That is invisible while the list is keyboard-only and fatal once it is not: a rebuild
/// replaces the containers under the pointer, so hover state is lost on every arrow key, the
/// <c>ScrollViewer</c> jumps back to the top, and a click lands on a control that no longer exists by
/// the time the selection it caused is applied.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the rows are now stable objects with a mutable selection, and the controller mutates rather
/// than rebuilds when only the selection changed. Reference identity is load-bearing in the other
/// direction too: the view maps a clicked container back to an index with
/// <c>Suggestions.IndexOf(item)</c>, which a record's value equality would answer with the first
/// row that happens to carry the same text.
