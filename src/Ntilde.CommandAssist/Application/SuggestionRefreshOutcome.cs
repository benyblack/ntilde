/// <param name="RequestedMode">
/// The mode the pass was queued for. The controller drops the outcome if the session has moved on to
/// a different mode since - a Help popup must not be overwritten by a Suggest pass that was already
/// in flight when it opened.
/// </param>
/// <param name="Query">
/// The query the pass actually ranked. Carried back rather than read from the view-model because as
/// of Phase 1c the pass resolves its own query - it reads the grid when the pass runs, not when the
/// keystroke that triggered it arrived - so the controller has no other way to know what the rows on
/// screen are rows *for*. This is what the view-model's <c>QueryText</c> is set from.
/// </param>
/// <param name="Suggestions">The ranked rows; empty when the pass failed.</param>
/// <param name="Faulted">
/// True when the candidate fetch or the ranking threw. The surface is cleared rather than left
/// showing rows from a previous query.
/// </param>
/// <param name="InsertionAppearsAvailable">
/// Whether an accept would have something to append to. Carried back so the hint strip can stop
/// advertising "insert" on a line where <c>CommandAssistInsertionPlanner</c> is going to refuse - which,
/// with PSReadLine's inline prediction showing, is every line (PR #293 review).
/// <para>
/// Deliberately <see langword="true"/> when the pass read no snapshot at all. A markless session does
/// refuse insertion, but "there is no grid to read" is a different condition from "the line cannot be
/// appended to", and the degraded-mode hint strip is not this change's subject: reporting unavailability
/// there would silently reword the strip for every un-instrumented shell. Only a snapshot that exists and
/// says no makes this false.
