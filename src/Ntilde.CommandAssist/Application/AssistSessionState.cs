/// Two axes are folded into this enum because the code has always treated them as one thing:
/// the <see cref="Models.CommandAssistMode"/> the session is in, and whether the popup is open on
/// top of the bubble. A third axis - whether the user asked for the session explicitly - is folded
/// in as well: it survives a round trip through the popup and through
/// <see cref="AssistSessionStateMachine.ObserveTypedInput"/>, so it cannot be a transient flag.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Environment facts are deliberately <em>not</em> here. Alt-screen, remoteness, whether shell
/// integration is configured and whether its markers have been seen describe the terminal the
/// session runs in, not what the session is doing; they live in
/// <see cref="AssistSessionContext"/> and gate transitions from the outside.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Popup-openness is not read off this enum.</strong> The state names say which states
/// <em>intend</em> the popup to be up, but the authority every code path actually consults is
/// <see cref="ViewModels.CommandAssistBarViewModel.IsPopupOpen"/> - the controller writes it, and
/// <c>SetSelectedIndex</c> / <c>ApplyRefreshOutcome</c> branch on it. The two can disagree (a
/// pre-existing latent bug: nothing keeps them in sync), so deriving a second predicate here would
/// only offer a plausible-looking answer that production does not use. Resolve the view-model sync
/// first; until then, treat the popup axis of these names as documentation, not as a source.

/// <para>
/// <strong>Public only for the transition table.</strong> Every member that traffics in this enum -
/// <see cref="AssistSessionStateMachine"/> and <c>CommandAssistController.SessionState</c> - is
/// <c>internal</c>, so nothing outside this assembly can reach a value of it in production. It stays
/// public because <c>AssistSessionStateMachineTests</c> drives the whole transition table through
/// <c>[Theory]</c> parameters of this type, and xUnit requires public test classes (xUnit1000),
/// which in turn requires their parameter types to be at least as accessible.
