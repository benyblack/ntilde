/// This is the other half of the split described on <see cref="AssistSessionStateMachine"/>. None of
/// these values say anything about what the assist surface is doing - they describe the terminal
/// underneath it. They change on their own schedule (a directory change, an alt-screen switch, a
/// marker arriving) rather than in response to the user driving the assist UI, which is exactly why
/// they are not states of <see cref="AssistSessionState"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Mutable and shared: the controller, the <see cref="CapturePipeline"/> and the
/// <see cref="SuggestionOrchestrator"/> all read the same instance, so a directory change observed
/// by a shell-integration event is immediately visible to the next ranking pass. All mutation goes
/// through named methods.
/// </para>

/// <strong>Threading contract.</strong> Every mutator here is called on the dispatcher thread - the
/// controller marshals shell-integration events and host callbacks there before touching this
/// object - but the readers are not all on it: <see cref="SuggestionOrchestrator"/> reads
/// <see cref="IsAcceptingCommandInput"/>, <see cref="IsAltScreenActive"/>,
/// <see cref="WorkingDirectory"/>, <see cref="ShellKind"/>, <see cref="ProfileId"/> and
/// <see cref="IsRemote"/> from the worker its refresh pass runs on. There is no lock, and the

/// </para>

/// First, <em>every field must stay reference-sized or bool-sized</em>. Those are written
/// atomically by the CLR, so a worker either sees the old value or the new one and never a torn
/// one. A future multi-field fact - a struct carrying a mark, a tuple of directory plus generation -
/// cannot simply be added here; it needs a lock or an immutable snapshot object swapped in as a
/// single reference (which is what <c>TerminalPane</c> does with its mark gate).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Second, <em>a stale read is tolerated rather than prevented</em>. A pass that reads the gate
/// microseconds before <c>133;C</c> closes it produces an outcome for a command line that has since
/// been submitted - and that outcome is dropped anyway, because the transition that closed the gate
/// came with a refresh that superseded the pass through
/// <c>SuggestionOrchestrator.CancelPending</c>. The window is real and the correctness argument is
/// supersession, not synchronization; anything that starts acting on these values <em>without</em>
/// going through a cancellable pass has to re-establish it.
