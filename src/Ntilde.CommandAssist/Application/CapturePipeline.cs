/// authoritative and survives multi-line input, history recall and line editing. The Enter-time
/// path is the host telling us what it could see on the command line when the user pressed Enter.
/// Since Phase 1c its first source is the terminal grid, read between the newest <c>OSC 133;B</c>
/// mark and the cursor. Since Phase 1d it has a second, strictly narrower source for the sessions
/// that have no marks at all (`cmd.exe`, a bailed-out bootstrap, an un-instrumented SSH host): the
/// host's <c>MarklessSubmissionAccumulator</c>, which offers a line only when the user typed it
/// straight through with no editing <em>and</em> that exact text is painted on the grid at the
/// cursor. It is not the V1 keystroke mirror returning - the mirror guessed, and its wrong guesses
/// went to permanent history; this one answers "nothing" for everything it cannot model, so what
/// reaches here is either the typed line verbatim or an empty string.
/// </para>

/// <see cref="AssistSessionContext.HasObservedStructuredCommandCaptureMarker"/> is set, and that only
/// becomes true when the first <c>CommandAccepted</c> arrives - which is after the first Enter. So
/// the first command of an instrumented session is captured twice unless something notices, and the
/// something is the pending-entry dedup below: an accepted command whose text matches the entry the
/// heuristic path just wrote is dropped, and the finish event patches the heuristic entry instead.
