/// for the passive typing bubble, for an explicit Suggest session, and for the direct insert chord.
/// <see cref="CommandAssistInsertionStyle.ReplaceTypedPrefix"/> carves out one surface:
/// <c>Ctrl+R</c> history search, where the characters on the line are a filter over a list rather
/// than the start of a command, and accepting a row means running <em>that row</em>. Everywhere else
/// the style is <see cref="CommandAssistInsertionStyle.Append"/> and the arithmetic is bit-identical
/// to what it always was.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why the carve-out was necessary rather than nice.</strong> <c>JsonlHistoryStore</c>
/// filters by <em>subsequence</em>, so a non-prefix row is the ordinary case in a filtered history
/// list, not an edge case: type <c>git</c>, select <c>echo git-alpha</c>, press <c>Enter</c>, and the
/// additive rule refuses - the key falls through to the shell, and the shell runs <c>git</c>. The
/// user asked for one command and got a different one. Additive's promise ("we never damage the
/// line") is worth a refusal when the alternative is a wrong edit; it is not worth a refusal when the
/// alternative is the user's own explicit selection.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Refusal is still a feature, and the refusals that remain are the ones that protect the

/// <item>the line already being the selected command - erasing N characters to retype the identical

/// </list>
/// <para>
