/// <para>
/// <strong>The pass owns the query (Phase 1c).</strong> Callers no longer hand one in; they say
/// "refresh" and the pass resolves the query itself, from
/// <see cref="AssistSessionContext.IsAcceptingCommandInput"/> plus the grid provider. A keystroke is
/// a <em>trigger</em>, not a source: what the user typed is already on screen, and the screen also
/// knows about the arrow keys, the <c>Ctrl+U</c>, the history recall and the Tab completion that no
/// keystroke mirror ever saw.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why the read happens here and not at the keystroke.</strong> The buffer's write lock is
/// taken per written character, so a read racing a prompt repaint (<c>\r</c>, erase-to-end, reprint)
/// can legitimately observe a half-erased line. Reading inside the pass puts the read behind the
/// queue hop the refresh already makes, and the per-pass cancellation below means that when several
/// keystrokes arrive together only the last pass's read is applied.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The debounce (V2 Phase 3b, task 1).</strong> Phase 0c deferred it here deliberately -
/// "the debounce is a policy decision and Phase 3 owns it" - and Phase 3b is where the policy
/// arrives, because the passive bubble makes the cost of a per-keystroke pass user-visible for the
/// first time. A typing-triggered pass now waits
/// <see cref="DefaultPassiveRefreshDebounce"/> before doing any work; the next keystroke cancels it
/// through the same <see cref="CancellationTokenSource"/> that already handled supersession, so a
/// burst of <em>n</em> keystrokes costs one grid read, one store recall and one ranking pass rather
/// than <em>n</em> of each.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It also closes the echo race that <c>CommandAssist_ShellIntegration_Gaps.md</c> documents as the
/// residual staleness (#286): the pass whose read beat the shell's echo of the last character was
/// racing that echo by microseconds, and 75 ms is several orders of magnitude more than a local echo
/// needs. The window is *narrowed to near-zero rather than closed*, and the distinction is worth
/// keeping honest - a remote shell whose echo takes longer than the debounce can still be read one
/// character stale, and insertion still refuses on <c>TerminalPane._hasUnechoedInput</c> rather than
/// trusting the delay. What is gone is the every-keystroke-is-a-race property.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Explicit passes are <em>not</em> debounced. <c>Ctrl+R</c>, <c>Ctrl+Space</c> and a pin toggle are
/// single user actions with nothing to coalesce, and 75 ms of nothing after a keypress the user
/// meant is exactly the latency the debounce exists to avoid spending.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Staleness is handled with a <see cref="CancellationTokenSource"/> per pass: queueing a refresh
/// cancels the one before it, and an outcome whose token is cancelled is dropped instead of applied.
/// This replaces the interlocked <c>_refreshVersion</c> counter that used to serve the same purpose.
/// Note that the token is deliberately <em>not</em> passed to the store or engine calls yet:
/// cancelling work already in flight is a behavior change Phase 0c did not want to make.
