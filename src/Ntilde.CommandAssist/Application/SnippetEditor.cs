/// <para>
/// <strong>Why this exists rather than the rules living in <c>SettingsWindow</c>.</strong> Until now
/// a snippet could only be created by pinning a suggestion (<c>Ctrl+Shift+S</c>) and could never be
/// renamed or deleted at all - <see cref="ISnippetStore.RemoveAsync"/> had no caller anywhere in the
/// app. The UI that fixes that is a handful of text boxes, but the rules underneath it are not
/// (what a blank name means, what a blank command means, what an edit must not silently destroy),
/// and <c>SettingsWindow</c> is an Avalonia <c>Window</c> that no test in this repo constructs. So
/// the rules live here, in the Avalonia-free assembly, where they are testable against a real store
/// on a real temp file; the window keeps the text boxes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Every mutation re-reads the store.</strong> <c>JsonSnippetStore.UpsertAsync</c> re-sorts
/// on write (pinned first, then by name), so the order after an edit is the store's to decide, and a
/// locally patched list would disagree with the file the moment a rename crossed a sort boundary.
/// Re-reading also means a snippet pinned from a pane while Settings is open shows up on the next
/// edit rather than being clobbered by a stale list.
