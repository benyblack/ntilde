/// A pane used to persist the arguments it was <em>launched</em> with, which included the
/// shell-integration bootstrap. On the next launch the provider saw its own <c>-File</c> (or, after
/// the execution-policy fix, its own <c>-EncodedCommand</c>) in the incoming arguments, took the
/// "the user supplied a script" bail-out, and passed the stale command line through unchanged —
/// so integration silently stopped and the old bootstrap kept being launched. Self-perpetuating,
/// because every launch re-saved it.
///
/// The pane no longer stores the merged command line, which stops this happening again. This is
/// for the sessions already on disk, which that fix cannot reach retroactively.
///
/// Deliberately narrow on both axes:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Only arguments identifiable as ours are dropped. A user's own <c>-File</c> or
/// <c>-EncodedCommand</c> is the exact case the bail-out exists to protect, and stripping it would
/// launch a shell they did not ask for.</item>
/// <item>When nothing is dropped the input is returned <em>verbatim</em>. Anything else rewrites
/// command lines this class has no business touching.</item>
