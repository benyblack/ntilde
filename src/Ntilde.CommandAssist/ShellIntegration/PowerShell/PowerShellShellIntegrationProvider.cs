    /// Policy, so it would not fix managed machines at all; and it relaxes the policy for the
    /// whole session, meaning scripts the USER later runs in that tab would also bypass — a
    /// side effect a terminal has no business imposing. Nothing is loaded from disk here, so
    /// no policy applies, and the user's own policy is left exactly as they set it.
