/// <strong>Every free-text member is a <see cref="RedactedText"/>.</strong> There is no exemption and
/// no "this one is safe" field: command text, the output tail, a user selection, the working
/// directory. Running the filter over a path is a no-op in practice, and the value of having no
/// exceptions is that the rule needs no judgement to apply and no argument to review. What is left as
/// a plain scalar is not free text at all - a shell kind this app itself determined, an integer exit
/// code, a boolean, and an opaque session id.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The constructor is <see langword="internal"/>.</strong> Providers consume requests; only
/// the assist assembly may make one. That closes the other half of the loop that
/// <see cref="RedactedText"/> opens: a provider in another assembly can neither mint redacted text nor
/// fabricate a request around text it obtained some other way, so the only requests in existence are
/// the ones the factory built.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No history, no scrollback, no environment.</strong> The request is the failing command (or
/// the command being asked about) plus the bounded tail of its output. It deliberately does not carry
/// the history corpus, the full scrollback, environment variables or the profile - none of which a
/// content question needs, and all of which would be a much larger thing to hand to a future network
/// provider. Widening this record is the decision point where that changes, which is why it is one
/// record in one file.
