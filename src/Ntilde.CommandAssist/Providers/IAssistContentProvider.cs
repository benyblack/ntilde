/// <strong>This is the whole of V2's AI work, and shipping only the seam is the point.</strong> The
/// V1 assist grew an AI-shaped hole that nothing filled and several things assumed; V2 instead makes
/// the local heuristics travel the exact path a remote provider would, so the path is exercised on
/// every Help and every Fix from the day it lands rather than on the day a provider first ships. What
/// is deliberately absent: any network call, any API client, any credential handling, any model
/// selection. Those are a separate milestone with their own design.

/// <strong>Implementations must treat <see cref="AssistContentRequest"/> as the complete input.</strong>
/// A provider that reads the filesystem, the environment or the terminal grid for extra context has
/// stepped around the redaction guarantee: the request is the audited surface, and anything a
/// provider adds to it was never filtered. The two local providers honour this - the command
/// catalogue is an embedded asset and the help probe checks <c>PATH</c> for existence only.
