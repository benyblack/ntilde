/// provider exists sends them looking for a better command instead of at Settings. The registry can

/// <strong>Honesty about reach.</strong> Every capability the shipped UI can ask for -
/// <see cref="AssistCapabilities.EnrichDocs"/> from Help, <see cref="AssistCapabilities.SuggestFix"/>
/// from a failed command - has a local provider registered at the App composition root, so in the
/// shipped app the "not configured" strings are unreachable: a user cannot turn a local provider off,
/// and there is nothing else to configure. They are reachable, and tested, for a controller composed
/// without those providers (a host embedding the assist assembly, the MCP surface, a test).

/// would be shipping a dead end and calling it a feature. The string exists so that the milestone
/// which adds the entry point has an answer ready instead of a blank popup, and it is exercised by
/// unit test rather than by UI.
