/// <para>
/// <strong>Sequential, in registration order.</strong> Not because concurrency is hard here, but
/// because order is content policy: the bundled catalogue answers before anything else would, so a
/// user with a future AI provider configured still sees the offline rows first and sees them at
/// local latency. Parallelism would trade that for a wall-clock saving the local providers do not
/// need.

/// <para>
/// <strong>A throwing provider costs its own rows and nothing else.</strong> Today both providers are
/// in-process and a throw means a bug; the reason to contain it now is that the shape of a future
/// provider is a timeout, a 500 and a rate limit, and the surface that must not die when those happen
/// is the Help popup showing perfectly good local content. Cancellation is not swallowed: a cancelled
/// token means the caller stopped caring, and that has to reach the caller.
