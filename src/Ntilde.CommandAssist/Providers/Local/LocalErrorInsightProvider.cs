/// by a large sample-driven test suite. Re-basing them on <see cref="IAssistContentProvider"/>
/// directly would have churned tested code to no end: the seam's job is to make the orchestrator's
/// path uniform, and thirty lines of translation here achieve that without touching a recogniser. The
/// service interface stays public and stays the thing a fix heuristic implements.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The translation reconstructs a <see cref="CommandFailureContext"/> out of the request - which is
/// worth reading as the seam demonstrating its own guarantee. The context the recognisers get is
/// built from redacted text only; there is no path back to the raw grid from here, and if a future
/// recogniser needs something the request does not carry, adding it to the request is the visible,
/// reviewable change that has to happen first.
