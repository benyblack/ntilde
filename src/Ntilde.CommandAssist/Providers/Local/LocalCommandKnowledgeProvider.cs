/// the 585-command tldr-derived asset V2 Phase 4b shipped, plus the local help probe.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two interfaces behind one provider, because Help asks one question.</strong>
/// <see cref="CommandKnowledgeService"/> implements both <see cref="ICommandDocsProvider"/> and
/// <see cref="IRecipeProvider"/> over one parsed catalogue, and the Help path has always asked both
/// in the same breath. Registering them as two providers would have doubled the request count and
/// invited a future composition where the doc rows and the example rows come from different
/// catalogues - which is not a thing anyone wants and not a thing the popup could label.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Attribution is read after the awaits, and that ordering is load-bearing.</strong> The
/// catalogue's licence line is a field inside the asset, so it exists only once the asset has been
/// parsed - and the two calls below are what parse it. Reading it before them yields null and the
/// CC BY-SA credit silently disappears from the popup footer. Asked through an optional interface
/// (<see cref="ICommandKnowledgeAttributionSource"/>) so that a source with nothing to credit simply
/// does not implement it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Either interface may be absent - a host that wants docs without examples, or a test. Absent both
/// is a caller error: register no provider instead, which is what makes the empty state honest.
