/// <para>
/// <strong>This type is the redaction-before-seam guarantee, and it is a type rather than a rule
/// because rules are enforced by reviewers and types are enforced by the compiler.</strong> The
/// guarantee V2 has to make is that no unredacted terminal text can reach a content provider - and a
/// future provider is the one that may put that text on a network. Written as a convention ("call
/// <c>SecretsFilter</c> before you build the request") it survives exactly as long as nobody adds a
/// second call site in a hurry. Written as a type it cannot be broken by accident: there is no public
/// constructor, no public conversion from <see cref="string"/>, and the single factory
/// (<see cref="Redact"/>) takes an <see cref="ISecretsFilter"/> as a parameter. You cannot produce a
/// <see cref="RedactedText"/> without having a filter in your hand and running it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What it does not claim.</strong> It is not proof that the text is secret-free - that is a
/// claim only a perfect filter could make, and <see cref="SecretsFilter"/> is six patterns. It is
/// proof that <em>the filter ran</em>, which is the property the seam can actually be held to and the
/// one a reviewer can check by reading one file. Improving the filter improves every request without
/// touching the seam.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Redaction is unconditional, even for text a caller has already redacted.</strong> The
/// failing-command output tail is filtered once at the VT boundary in <c>TerminalPane</c> (where the
/// raw grid text stops being the VT layer's) and again here. That is deliberate duplication: a
/// guarantee that holds only when every upstream caller remembered is not a guarantee. Redaction is
/// idempotent in practice - the patterns do not match <c>[REDACTED]</c> - so the second pass costs a
/// regex sweep over at most 8 KB and changes nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Empty"/> is the answer for absent text, so a provider never has to distinguish "no
/// output" from "output that redacted to nothing".
