/// Separate from <see cref="CommandAssistJsonContext"/> because the two have nothing in common but

/// <c>WriteIndented = true</c>, this one only ever reads one immutable embedded asset and never
/// writes. Options are baked into a generated context, so "read-only, no indentation opinion" is a
/// second context rather than a second call.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Source-generated rather than reflection-based for the reason the storage contexts are: the app
/// publishes with <c>PublishAot</c>, where reflection-based deserialization of these record types
/// would be trimmed away and fail at runtime rather than at build time.
