# Ntilde MCP server

A local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes
Ntilde's project knowledge — and, opt-in, its live terminal sessions — to AI coding agents
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, etc.). It helps you explore the architecture, understand
VT/ANSI behavior, author or validate theme and SSH connection-profile JSON, and (when you enable
it) observe and drive running sessions — without leaving your editor.

## Safety posture

The server has two tool families with different postures:

**Repo / dev-companion tools** (docs, config validators, VT conformance) are deliberately
constrained and isolated:

- **Read-only and offline.** They never execute shell commands, open SSH connections, access
  saved credentials or private keys, or reach the network. Filesystem access is confined to
  `docs/` (reads reject path traversal, absolute paths, and symlink escapes).

**Live-session tools** proxy the running Ntilde app over a per-user local IPC endpoint and
are gated by explicit, default-off user opt-ins:

- **Observe** (`list_sessions`, `read_screen`, `read_scrollback`, `get_session_status`,
  `wait_for_events`, `export_replay`, `capture_screen`) requires "Agent access (observe)".
  Read-only. `export_replay` additionally requires the "Agent replay export" sub-toggle and never
  records typed input. `capture_screen` needs nothing beyond observe: its default `render` mode
  re-renders the pane offscreen from its buffer (never a screen grab), so the image contains that
  pane's grid and nothing else, and the pane's agent-access indicator lights when an agent captures
  it. `mode=live` photographs the on-screen control instead, for the background image and window
  opacity a buffer re-render cannot carry.
- **Act** (`send_input`, `spawn_session`, `close_session`) requires a *separate* "Agent access
  (act)" opt-in on top of observe; SSH sessions additionally require a per-profile allowlist. Every
  acting call — allowed or denied — is recorded in an in-app activity journal. See the threat model
  at [`docs/agent-host/2026-07-12-acting-threat-model.md`](../../docs/agent-host/2026-07-12-acting-threat-model.md).
- When neither toggle is on, no live-session endpoint exists and these tools return guidance
  instead of data.

The only cross-assembly dependency is the zero-reference `Ntilde.AgentHost.Contracts` leaf
(the IPC wire types); dev-companion schemas that mirror real types are kept honest by drift-guard
tests in `tests/Ntilde.McpServer.Tests`.

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 (`net10.0`), C#
- [`ModelContextProtocol`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol) SDK
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`
- Transport: **stdio** (JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout)

## Build

Use the repo's build wrapper (raw `dotnet build` can hang when stdout is captured — see the root
`CLAUDE.md`):

```bash
# Windows / PowerShell
scripts/build.ps1 build -c Release src/Ntilde.McpServer

# Linux / macOS / Git Bash
scripts/build.sh build -c Release src/Ntilde.McpServer
```

This produces `src/Ntilde.McpServer/bin/Release/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll`.

## Run

Run the **built DLL** directly:

```bash
dotnet src/Ntilde.McpServer/bin/Release/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll
```

> ⚠️ **Do not use `dotnet run`.** It emits build/restore output to stdout, which corrupts the MCP
> JSON-RPC stream the client reads. Always launch the compiled DLL. (All logging in the server is
> pinned to stderr for the same reason.)

The server speaks stdio and is meant to be launched **by an MCP client**, not run interactively —
on its own it will simply wait for JSON-RPC input.

### Repository root discovery

Tools that read repo docs need to know where the repository is. The server resolves the root by:

1. The `NTILDE_REPO_ROOT` environment variable, if set; otherwise
2. Walking up from the current directory until it finds `Ntilde.sln`.

When a client launches the server from an arbitrary working directory, set
`NTILDE_REPO_ROOT` explicitly (see the example configs below).

## Client setup

Ready-to-edit example configs live in [`examples/mcp/`](../../examples/mcp/):

- **Claude Code** — `claude mcp add ntilde -- dotnet "<path-to-repo>/src/Ntilde.McpServer/bin/Release/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll"`
- **Claude Desktop** — [`examples/mcp/claude_desktop_config.json`](../../examples/mcp/claude_desktop_config.json)
- **VS Code** (`.vscode/mcp.json`) — [`examples/mcp/vscode_mcp_config.json`](../../examples/mcp/vscode_mcp_config.json)

Both follow the same shape: launch `dotnet` with the path to the built DLL and set
`NTILDE_REPO_ROOT`. Build the project once first, then point the config at the DLL. For
Claude Desktop, replace `/absolute/path/to/nova2` with your local clone path; the VS Code config
uses `${workspaceFolder}`.

Example (Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ntilde-dev": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/nova2/src/Ntilde.McpServer/bin/Release/net10.0/Ntilde.McpServer.dll"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NTILDE_REPO_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/nova2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After editing the config, restart the client; the `ntilde-dev` tools should appear in its
tool list.

## Tools

The repo / dev-companion tools below are read-only and offline. The live-session tools
(`list_sessions`, `read_screen`, `read_scrollback`, `get_session_status`, `wait_for_events`,
`export_replay`, `capture_screen`, `send_input`, `spawn_session`, `close_session`) proxy the running app and require
the opt-in toggles described under **Safety posture** — the last three *act* on sessions. See
[`docs/mcp/tools.md`](../../docs/mcp/tools.md) for the authoritative list and notes; the
dev-companion set:

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `ntilde.get_project_summary` | — | What Ntilde is, tech stack, assembly/module layout, key conventions. Start here. |
| `ntilde.get_architecture_map` | — | The module-ownership map: per-assembly namespaces, dependencies, responsibilities, invariants. |
| `ntilde.list_docs` | — | Lists Markdown docs under `docs/`. |
| `ntilde.read_doc` | `path` | Reads a doc by path relative to `docs/` (traversal rejected). |
| `ntilde.get_vt_conformance_summary` | — | VT/ANSI conformance status and known gaps. |
| `ntilde.explain_escape_sequence` | `sequence` | Explains a VT/ANSI escape sequence (e.g. `ESC[2J`, `CSI ?25h`, `OSC 8`). |
| `ntilde.generate_vt_test_plan` | `feature` | A structured VT test plan (cases, where tests live, verification). |
| `ntilde.get_theme_schema` | — | Theme JSON schema: required fields, color formats, example. |
| `ntilde.validate_theme_json` | `themeJson` | Validates a theme JSON; reports missing fields, invalid colors, unknown fields. |
| `ntilde.get_connection_profile_schema` | — | SSH connection-profile JSON schema: PascalCase fields by area, integer enum mappings, defaults, example. Covers a single profile or a full `profiles.json` document. |
| `ntilde.validate_connection_profile_json` | `profileJson` | Validates a connection-profile JSON (single profile or full document, auto-detected); reports wrong types, out-of-range integer enums/ports, missing `Name`/`Host`, and warns on unknown fields and any stray `Password`. |
| `ntilde.get_settings_schema` | — | The settings.json schema: top-level fields by area (PascalCase, integer enums for embedded profiles), types, defaults, and an example. Top-level shape only. |
| `ntilde.validate_settings_json` | `settingsJson` | Validates a settings.json string (top-level shape); reports wrong types, out-of-range numerics, malformed `DefaultProfileId`, bad collection shapes, and warns on unknown fields and any stray `Password`. Embedded profiles are not deep-validated. |
| `ntilde.generate_codex_prompt_for_issue` | `title`, `description?` | A structured implementation prompt (relevant areas, constraints, PR size, steps, tests, acceptance, risks). |
| `ntilde.suggest_relevant_files` | `topic` | The concrete source/test files most relevant to a topic (e.g. `reflow`, `glyph atlas`, `ssh key auth`). |
| `ntilde.backup_export` | `destinationPath`, `rootDirectory?` | Exports Ntilde's configuration (settings, themes, connections, workspaces, policy, snippets — never passwords) to a `.ntildebackup` file at `destinationPath`. `destinationPath` must be absolute — a relative path is rejected with a text failure rather than resolved against the server process's own working directory. Use before changing configuration so the user can roll back. |
| `ntilde.backup_list` | `rootDirectory?` | Lists automatic configuration snapshots, newest first, with id, reason, timestamp, and size. |

Self-contained tools (no filesystem access): `get_project_summary`, `get_theme_schema`,
`validate_theme_json`, `get_connection_profile_schema`, `validate_connection_profile_json`,
`get_settings_schema`, `validate_settings_json`, `generate_codex_prompt_for_issue`. The rest read
files under `docs/` and need the repo root; `backup_export` and `backup_list` read/write the app
data root instead (`rootDirectory`, defaulting to the current user's Ntilde directory).

**`backup_export` and `backup_list` are deliberately read-only — there is no `backup_import` or
`backup_restore` tool.** Those would replace the user's live configuration, and an out-of-process
MCP agent doing that silently is a destructive action the user never sees. Export-before-you-change
is the useful half of backup/restore and carries no risk; import and restore stay confined to the
in-app Settings page and the `backup` CLI verb, where the user is present.

### Example: validate a profile

Ask your agent: *"Validate this connection profile."* The agent calls
`validate_connection_profile_json` with your JSON. Note the on-disk format uses **PascalCase**
keys and **integer-valued enums** (call `get_connection_profile_schema` for the mappings).
Passwords are stored in the OS credential vault and must never appear in profile JSON — a stray
`Password` field is flagged.

## Development

Run the test project (targeted — the full solution test suite is slow):

```bash
scripts/build.ps1 test tests/Ntilde.McpServer.Tests
```
