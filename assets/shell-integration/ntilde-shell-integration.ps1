# Ntilde remote shell integration (PowerShell / pwsh).
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Emits the OSC 133 shell-integration marks and OSC 7 working-directory
#   reports that Ntilde's Command Assist reads:
#     OSC 7               the current directory, once per prompt
#     OSC 133;A           prompt start
#     OSC 133;B           prompt end / first cell of your input
#     OSC 133;C;<b64>     the line you submitted, base64-encoded
#     OSC 133;D;<n>;<ms>  exit code and duration of the command that just ran
#   Ntilde cannot inject this over SSH (the -File bootstrap does not survive the
#   hop), so you install it on the remote host yourself.
#
# INSTALL (on the REMOTE host, in pwsh)
#   1. New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Split-Path $PROFILE)
#   2. notepad $PROFILE      # or: code $PROFILE / vi $PROFILE
#      Paste this whole file at the end and save.
#      (Or save it as ~/.ntilde-shell-integration.ps1 and add
#       `. ~/.ntilde-shell-integration.ps1` to $PROFILE.)
#   3. Open a new Ntilde session to that host.
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - Your `prompt` function is wrapped, never replaced. If you have none, the
#     PowerShell default is synthesized.
#   - Dot-sourcing this file twice does not wrap the wrapper.
#   - An existing PSReadLine Enter binding is delegated to rather than dropped,
#     as long as it is a NAMED PSReadLine function (AcceptLine,
#     AcceptOrInsertNewline, ValidateAndAcceptLine, ...). A custom SCRIPTBLOCK
#     bound to Enter cannot be read back out of PSReadLine by any public API,
#     so it is replaced; if you have one, re-bind it after this file.
#
# WHAT YOU LOSE WITHOUT PSReadLine
#   PSReadLine is where both the C mark and the command clock come from, so a
#   host without it gets OSC 7, A and B only: no `133;C` command text AND no
#   `133;D`, because there is no accepted command to time. Ntilde falls back to
#   reading the command line off the grid between B and the cursor, which is
#   what an un-instrumented shell already does for text; it has no fallback for
#   exit codes or durations.

# call itself forever. Two guards, because a second pass may get a fresh script
# scope where the first guard alone cannot see the earlier capture:
#   1. don't overwrite an already-captured original in this scope;
#   2. never capture a `prompt` whose body carries our wrapper sentinel.
# Worst case (fresh scope + already-wrapped prompt) this degrades to the
# synthesized default prompt; it never recurses.

    # is a different URI and not the one the user is in. On Windows the drive
    # letter has no leading slash and does need one added, and the separators
    # have to be flipped before they are escaped as %5C.

    # Two further fixes, and they are why there is no hostname here any more:
    #   * No authority. `file://HOST/C:/Users/you` is a well-formed URI whose

    #     on the machine that emitted it. Nothing consumes the hostname.
    #   * Per-segment escaping. EscapeUriString leaves the URI-reserved '#' and
    #     '?' alone, so a directory named `a#b` truncated at the fragment;
    #     EscapeDataString covers them. ':' is put back afterwards because a
    #     drive letter is an ordinary path-segment character in a URI.
