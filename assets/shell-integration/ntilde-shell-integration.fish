# Ntilde remote shell integration (fish).
#
# fish is not POSIX sh and cannot source ntilde-shell-integration.sh: `case`,
# `$-`, `local`, function syntax and array syntax all differ. This file is the
# fish equivalent and emits exactly the same marks.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   OSC 7            the current directory, once per prompt
#   OSC 133;A        prompt start
#   OSC 133;B        prompt end / first cell of your input
#   OSC 133;C;<b64>  the line you submitted, base64-encoded
#   OSC 133;D;<n>;<ms>  exit code and duration of the command that just ran
#
# INSTALL (on the REMOTE host)
#   1. mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/conf.d
#   2. cat > ~/.config/fish/conf.d/ntilde-shell-integration.fish
#      ...paste this whole file, then press Ctrl-D...
#   3. Open a new Ntilde session to that host.
#   conf.d is auto-sourced by fish, so there is no loader line to add.
#
# GUARANTEES
#   - Your fish_prompt is wrapped around, never replaced.
#   - Sourcing this file twice is a no-op the second time.
#   - Non-interactive shells install nothing.
#
# Docs: docs/command-assist/RemoteShellIntegration.md

# Everything lives inside one guard block rather than behind an early exit:
# `exit` in a sourced fish file exits the SHELL, and top-level `return` is not
# portable across fish versions.
#
#   status is-interactive  - a non-interactive fish must stay byte-clean, since
#                            an OSC written into an scp/rsync stream corrupts it
#   __ntilde_shell_integration_loaded - conf.d is sourced once per shell, but
#                            `exec fish`, a manual `source` and a fish_config
#                            reload all re-run it; installing twice would emit
#                            every mark twice
