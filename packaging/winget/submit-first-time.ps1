.SYNOPSIS
    One-time bootstrap submission of Ntilde to the winget community repo.

.DESCRIPTION
    The first winget-pkgs submission must be done by hand (the release.yml
    'submit_winget' job uses `wingetcreate update`, which only works once the
    package already exists upstream). This script does that first submission
    from the in-repo manifest set.

    It:
      1. verifies winget + wingetcreate are available (installs wingetcreate if not),
      2. validates the manifest set locally,
      3. submits it to microsoft/winget-pkgs, opening a PR from your fork.

    You must supply a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with 'public_repo'
    scope — wingetcreate uses it to fork winget-pkgs and open the PR. Create one
    at https://github.com/settings/tokens. This script never stores it.

.PARAMETER Version
    The rendered manifest folder to submit (see README.md, 'Cutting a manifest').

.PARAMETER Token
    GitHub PAT. If omitted, the WINGET_PAT environment variable is used.

.EXAMPLE
    ./submit-first-time.ps1 -Version 1.0.0 -Token ghp_xxx

.EXAMPLE
    $env:WINGET_PAT = 'ghp_xxx'; ./submit-first-time.ps1 -Version 1.0.0
