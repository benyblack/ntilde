# --- version mapping -------------------------------------------------------
# NOT the Debian mapping, and the difference is load-bearing. dpkg gives '~' a
# sorts-before-everything meaning, so build-deb.sh maps v0.8.0-rc.1 to
# 0.8.0~rc.1-1 and gets correct prerelease ordering for free. pacman's vercmp has
# no such rule - it is rpmvercmp-derived and treats '~' as just another separator.
# Verified on pacman 7.1.0 (Arch, 2026-09-14):
#
#   $ vercmp 0.8.0~rc.1 0.8.0   ->  1    # WRONG: prerelease sorts ABOVE the release
#   $ vercmp 0.8.0.rc.1 0.8.0   ->  1    # WRONG, same reason
#   $ vercmp 0.8.0rc1   0.8.0   -> -1    # correct
#
# The rule that produces the right answer is rpmvercmp's: when one version runs out
# of segments where the other has an ALPHABETIC segment, the alphabetic one is
# older. So the prerelease label must be glued to the release with no separator and
# stripped of its own dots: 0.8.0-rc.1 -> 0.8.0rc1, 0.8.0-beta.1 -> 0.8.0beta1.
# Ordering among prereleases then falls out of the same comparison (beta1 < rc1
# alphabetically; rc1 < rc2 numerically).
#
# Copying the '~' from build-deb.sh would have looked right, passed review by
# analogy, and silently offered every rc to users as an upgrade over the stable
# release it precedes.

# --- runtime-loaded (dlopen'd) libraries, mapped to Arch packages -----------
# The Arch half of build-deb.sh's DLOPEN_LIBS table. Same soname keys, Arch package
# names in the value column, and THE TWO ARE GATED AGAINST EACH OTHER below
# (assert_dlopen_map_covers_deb): a soname added to build-deb.sh with no entry here
# fails this script rather than quietly shipping an AUR package that installs
# cleanly and then cannot open a window.
#
# That gate is the entire reason this table is a table and not a hand-written
# depends= line in a PKGBUILD. namcap cannot help here: it derives dependencies from
# ELF links, and EIGHT of these eleven are invisible to `ldd` because Avalonia
# dlopen's them at runtime. A PKGBUILD whose depends= was namcap-derived would be
# missing all eight - the same defect the Debian lane's two-mechanism design exists
# to prevent, reintroduced on a different distro.

# Runtime dependencies that are NOT in build-deb.sh's dlopen table and so cannot be
# derived from it. Each is here for a stated reason; this list is short on purpose.
#
#   glibc, gcc-libs - the only real DT_NEEDED of the whole bundle. Measured on the
#       published v0.8.0 linux-x64 tarball: the AOT binary needs libm/libc/ld only,
#       librusty_pty.so and librusty_ssh.so add libgcc_s.so.1 (gcc-libs), and
#       libSkiaSharp.so adds libfontconfig.so.1 (already above). Everything else the
#       process maps is reached through one of those.
#   icu - dlopen'd by .NET's globalization stack, so `ldd` and namcap are both blind
#       to it, exactly like the eleven above. It is NOT in build-deb.sh's table
#       because the Debian side has to express it as a version-pinned alternatives
#       group (libicu74 | libicu72 | ...) in its depends= line instead. Arch ships
#       one unversioned `icu`, so it is a plain dependency here - but it still needs
#       to be SOMEWHERE this script can see, or it is the one runtime dependency
#       nothing on this lane checks.
#
# Deliberately NOT listed, and this is where the Arch depends= diverges from the
# Debian Depends: most visibly: brotli, freetype2, libpng, util-linux-libs. Those
# appear in the .deb because build-deb.sh derives via `ldd`, which walks the full
# TRANSITIVE closure and so surfaces fontconfig's and glib2's own dependencies as if
# they were ours. On Arch they arrive through fontconfig and glib2; listing them
# again is redundant and namcap flags it. Verified against the running process on
# Arch (2026-09-14): every one of them was mapped, none of them by us.
#   hicolor-icon-theme - owns /usr/share/icons/hicolor and ships the pacman hook
#       that rebuilds the icon cache. The PKGBUILD justifies having no .install
#       scriptlet by pointing at that hook; without this dependency that argument is
#       circular, because on a minimal system nothing guarantees the hook is there
#       and the installed icons never reach the app menu. namcap says so at ERROR
#       level ("Dependency hicolor-icon-theme detected and not included"), which is
#       how this was caught - the first smoke run passed every hand-written
#       assertion and still shipped it.

  # a hard dependency on a package name that predates neither.

# WHY NO LOCAL SOURCE FILES: the desktop entry, man page, icon and licence are
# fetched from the tag over HTTPS instead of being copied into the AUR repo beside
# the PKGBUILD. Two reasons, one of them measured:
#   * packaging/linux/ntilde.desktop and ntilde.1 stay the single source of truth for
#     both Linux packages. A copy in the AUR repo is a copy that drifts.
#   * src/Ntilde.App/Assets/ntilde_icon.png is 662 KB (and is, despite the
#     extension, a JPEG - ImageMagick sniffs content, which is why build-deb.sh
#     never noticed). Committing that into an AUR repo re-uploads it on every
#     release bump for no benefit.
# The sums below are computed from the LOCAL checkout, so this script must run at
# the tag it is generating for - the release workflow checks out
# release_metadata.checkout_ref before calling it. If the two ever disagree,
# makepkg's own integrity check is what catches it, loudly, on the next build;
# smoke-test.sh runs a real makepkg against the real URLs for that reason.
# --source-ref closes the gap the paragraph above describes rather than documenting
# it. With a ref, the four sums are read from that ref's BLOBS via `git show`, so the
# PKGBUILD's sha256sums always describe the same bytes its raw.githubusercontent URLs
# serve - regardless of what the working tree happens to hold.
#
# That is not a convenience. Without it, CI on a branch that edits ntilde.desktop (or
# the man page, icon, or LICENSE) generates a PKGBUILD pinning the BRANCH's sum
# against the TAG's URL, and the smoke test fails an integrity check that has nothing
# to do with the change under review - a false red on the one lane meant to catch

# faked - a hand-written .SRCINFO that disagrees with the PKGBUILD is worse than
# an absent one, which at least fails at push time instead of installing something
# other than what the PKGBUILD says.
#
# A failure to produce it is NOT fatal to this script: the PKGBUILD is already
# written and correct, and killing the run here would report "generation failed"
# for a file that generated fine. CI learned this the hard way - the generator
# tests run in a container as root, makepkg REFUSES to run as root, and both
# full-generation tests failed on a step that had already done its job.

  #   * a failed makepkg leaves a ZERO-BYTE .SRCINFO, because `> .SRCINFO` creates
  #     the file before makepkg ever runs;
  #   * regenerating into a REUSED output directory leaves the PREVIOUS version's
  #     .SRCINFO in place beside a freshly overwritten PKGBUILD.
  # The second is the nastier one: the file is valid, non-empty, and describes the
  # wrong version, so it passes `test -s` and would be pushed to the AUR as metadata
  # for a package it does not match.
