# --- version mapping -------------------------------------------------------
# dpkg reads the LAST '-' in a version as the revision separator, so a SemVer
# prerelease passed through unchanged would parse as upstream 0.5.0 revision
# "beta.1" and sort ABOVE the eventual 0.5.0-1. '~' sorts before everything, so the
# prerelease separator becomes '~'. Mirrors release.yml's `contains('-')` prerelease
# test, which reads the same '-' the same way.
#
# The '~' in the replacement MUST be escaped: bash subjects the replacement text of
# ${param/pattern/string} to tilde expansion, so an unescaped '~' becomes the home
# directory ("/root", "/c/Users/<user>", ...) instead of a literal tilde. Verified
# against bash 5.1 (ubuntu:22.04) and 5.2 (git-bash) - both expand it unescaped.

# --- runtime-loaded (dlopen'd) libraries -----------------------------------
# ONE TABLE, TWO COLUMNS, ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH: "<soname>|<Depends: relation>".
#
# These libraries are opened at RUNTIME (P/Invoke module resolution, or an explicit
# NativeLibrary.Load), so `ldd` cannot see them and the ldd-driven derivation below
# will never produce them. They have to be declared, and a declaration nobody checks
# is worthless - so the same table drives both mechanisms:
#
#   * the relation column lands in Depends: (below, and via --print-dlopen-relations)
#   * the soname column is what smoke-test.sh asserts actually resolves inside a
#     pristine container that has installed NOTHING but this .deb
#     (via --print-dlopen-sonames)
#
# WHY ONE TABLE AND NOT TWO LISTS: until now the packaging list lived here and the
# smoke-test assertion list lived in smoke-test.sh, hand-maintained separately. A
# library missing from both was therefore invisible to both mechanisms at once - the
# .deb shipped without the dependency AND the gate never looked for it. That is
# exactly how libsecret-1.so.0 / libglib-2.0.so.0 (LinuxSecretStore, i.e. persistent
# SSH password storage) survived nine review rounds: a clean install on a machine
# without libsecret hit LinuxSecretStore's `catch (DllNotFoundException)` and
# silently reported IsAvailable == false, with no user-visible error. Adding a line
# here now moves the package and its gate together, or neither moves.
#
# Column separator is the FIRST '|' only ("${e%%|*}" / "${e#*|}"), so a relation may
# itself be a Debian alternatives group containing '|' - which libglib needs, see
# below.
DLOPEN_LIBS=(
  # SkiaSharp font enumeration. Also a real DT_NEEDED of libSkiaSharp.so, so ldd

  # transition and no longer ship a `libglib2.0-0` at all (verified: `apt-cache
  # policy libglib2.0-0` on noble reports "Candidate: (none)"), while 22.04 and
  # Debian 12 only have the old name. A hard dependency on either one alone would be
  # uninstallable on half the supported range. libglib2.0-0{,t64} also ships
  # libgobject-2.0.so.0, which is what Avalonia's optional GTK path wants.

#       Avalonia.X11's GtkSystemDialog - the FALLBACK file picker. X11PlatformOptions

#       is pure managed Tmds.DBus.Protocol over a unix socket, no native library at
#       all. With neither portal nor GTK the app still starts and runs; only the file
#       picker is unavailable, and every call site here already guards
#       `topLevel?.StorageProvider == null`. Hard-depending on libgtk-3-0 to recover
#       a fallback would pull a large GTK stack into every install.
#   libvulkan.so.1
#       Avalonia.X11's Vulkan rendering mode. Not selected: this app never sets

#   libdbus-1.so.3
#       Avalonia.FreeDesktop.AtSpi's AT-SPI accessibility bridge, loaded only once an
#       assistive technology activates the a11y bus. Not on the launch path (the

Description: Modern terminal emulator
 Ntilde is a cross-platform terminal emulator with GPU-accelerated
 rendering, native SSH support, and tight shell integration.
 .
 This package installs the graphical application and the "ntilde" command. It does
 not register Ntilde as the system x-terminal-emulator; see ntilde(1) for how
 to do that yourself.
 .
 Updates are delivered through your package manager. The in-app updater is
 inactive for package installs, and applies only to the AppImage build.
