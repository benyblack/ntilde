# __VERSION__ and __SHA256__ are placeholders, never committed real: the release
# workflow (release.yml, "Update Homebrew tap") substitutes them with sed before
# pushing the file into the tap repo, and packaging/homebrew/bootstrap-tap.sh does
# the same for the one-time manual bootstrap. Keep this file's syntax valid Ruby on
# its own; the release lane runs `ruby -c` on the substituted output before pushing.

  # The osx lane currently publishes Apple Silicon only (release.yml matrix:
