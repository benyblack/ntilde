# Every dotnet invocation goes through scripts/build.ps1 rather than calling `dotnet`
# directly. Raw `dotnet build` spawns MSBuild worker nodes and a build server that
# inherit this script's stdout/stderr; when a parent captures those pipes the handles
# outlive the build and the reader never sees EOF, so the whole thing hangs. The wrapper
# encodes -nodeReuse:false and DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER=0. See CLAUDE.md and
# Directory.Build.props. (#174)

# NOTE: -warnaserror is deliberately absent. It was here while GitHub CI did not pass it

# Enforced as of #216: the 674 pre-existing whitespace violations that made this
# report-only have been swept, and `.gitattributes` now pins line endings so the check
# reaches the same verdict on Windows and Linux (it did not before - `.editorconfig`
# wants CRLF while git stores LF, so the answer depended on core.autocrlf).

# Scoped to `whitespace` deliberately. A bare `dotnet format` also runs the style and
# analyzer passes, whose diagnostics are #108's territory; mixing them in here would
