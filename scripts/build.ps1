# Wrapper around `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`/etc. that prevents long-lived MSBuild
# worker nodes and the dotnet MSBuild build server from outliving the invocation.
#
# Why this exists: `dotnet build` spawns daemons that inherit the caller's stdout/stderr
# handles. When a parent (test harness, CI runner, Claude Code's Bash tool) captures
# stdout via pipes, the daemons hold the write end of the pipe after the build exits,
# so ReadToEnd() never sees EOF and the parent hangs indefinitely. The hang typically
# surfaces in BuildCliShim because that target's nested `dotnet build` is the last to
# emit output.
#
# Usage: scripts/build.ps1 [args...]   # passed to `dotnet`, e.g. `build src/...` or `test`
#
# Defaults: `dotnet build` if no args given.

# Refuse to run on a toolchain that cannot compile anything, because the exit code will not
# say so. When global.json pins an SDK that is not installed, the host prints "A compatible
# .NET SDK was not found" and has been seen exiting 0 (#347), so the wrapper propagates a
# success for a build that produced nothing - satisfying a CI step, a && chain, and anyone
# reading $LASTEXITCODE. It bit for real when main pinned a preview SDK that was later pulled
# from the CDN: a fresh worktree could not build, and the wrapper said it had.
#
# The exit code is not the thing to fix. The same input on the machine this was written on
# exits 155, so the code is a host implementation detail that varies by version and platform,
# and the bug was reported from Linux. A guard keyed to 0 would be inert exactly where the
# next variation shows up.
#
# Matching the error text is no better: that message is localized, so a scan for the English
# spelling would be a silent no-op on a translated host - the mistake the test-abort guard
# below had to be corrected for once already. So assert the *success* shape instead. On
# success `dotnet --version` prints a bare version and nothing else; the failure output does
# contain version-like lines - it lists the installed SDKs - but every one carries a trailing
# " [path]", so anchoring both ends separates them in any language.

# Which invocations need an SDK, decided by the first argument that is not an option.
#
# Two earlier drafts of this predicate were wrong in the same direction, both caught by local
# codex review, and the shape of the mistake is worth keeping written down. The first listed
# the verbs to guard, which let `vstest`, `watch`, `tool`, `format` and anything added later
# reproduce the exact bug being guarded. The second inverted that but tested only the leading
# token, so `--diagnostics build` - a documented SDK-global form - read as SDK-free because it
# starts with a dash. An allowlist of a hazard's known spellings catches only the known
# spellings, which is also what the architecture guard in #422 had to be corrected for.
#
# So skip leading options and judge what follows. The exemptions are the forms that need no
# SDK at all: options alone (--info, --list-sdks, --version) are answered by the shared host,
# and `exec` or a bare app.dll run on the runtime. Those keep working when nothing resolves,
# and the first two are precisely what someone runs to find out why nothing does - a guard
# that swallowed them would take the diagnosis away along with the failure.
#
# Over-guarding is close to free here: when an SDK does resolve, the probe costs ~150ms and
# changes nothing. Under-guarding is what returns a green for a build that never happened, so
# anything ambiguous is guarded.
#
# Known and deliberate limit: a host option that takes a VALUE (--roll-forward LatestMajor
# app.dll, --fx-version, --additionalprobingpath) puts a non-option token in front of the
# .dll, so this guards a runtime-only run that did not need guarding. Fixing it means a table
# of which host options consume a value - the very allowlist-of-known-spellings shape that
# produced both defects above, and one whose failure mode when incomplete is the silent green
# this whole guard exists to stop. The trade is deliberate: this direction costs a loud, wrong
# refusal on a form that appears nowhere in the repo or its docs, and the other direction
# costs a build that reports success without building. No invocation like it exists today; if
# one ever does, exempt it explicitly rather than teaching this predicate to parse the host's
# option grammar.
