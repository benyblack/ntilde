"""
Behaviour matrix for the SDK-resolution guard in scripts/build.sh and scripts/build.ps1.

The guard exists because a wrapper that reports success for a build which produced nothing is
worse than no wrapper: CLAUDE.md tells every contributor and agent to use these scripts, so
this is the exit code the project's tooling is built on. When global.json pins an SDK that is
not installed, the host prints "A compatible .NET SDK was not found" and has been seen exiting
0 (#347), and that zero used to travel all the way out.

Two things here are easy to get wrong later, so they are cases rather than comments:

  * The guard must not key on the exit code. The same input exits 0 on the Linux host that
    reported #347 and 155 on the Windows machine that fixed it, so both are in the table.
  * It must not key on the English error text, because the host localizes it. The "localized"
    case carries no English at all; a guard grepping for "A compatible .NET SDK was not found"
    passes every other case here and fails only that one.

Each case also asserts whether the underlying command RAN, not only what the wrapper exited
with. A guard that returned 1 while still letting the build proceed would satisfy an
exit-code-only table, and so would one that blocked everything - including the host queries
you need in order to diagnose a broken resolver.

Plain python with no test framework, matching the rest of scripts/. Run it directly:

    python scripts/tests/build_wrapper_sdk_guard_tests.py

Exits non-zero if any case behaves differently from the table at the bottom.
