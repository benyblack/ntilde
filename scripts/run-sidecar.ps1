# Build Ntilde, mirror the fresh output to a fixed sidecar directory, and launch it
# from there. Also mirrors the MCP dev-companion server, which is launched separately by an
# MCP client rather than by this script.
#
# Why this exists: running the app holds a lock on its DLLs, so a `dotnet build` of the main
# repo fails with "file in use" while an instance is running. The workaround has been to copy
# bin/ by hand and run the copy side-by-side — but a hand copy goes stale silently, and you
# end up chasing bugs that were already fixed (see the GlobalHotkey crash incident: a stale
# "net10.0 - Copy" binary still had the pre-fix WndProc bug).
#
# This script removes the manual step: every launch rebuilds and re-mirrors, so the sidecar
# is always current, while the main repo bin stays unlocked for `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`.
# The running build is identifiable in debug.log via the "Build: sha=... built=... path=..."
# line (the sidecar path makes it obvious you're on the sidecar, not the repo output).
#
# Ntilde.McpServer gets the same treatment (#211). It is a long-lived process started
# by whatever MCP client is configured, and while it ran from the repo tree it held
# Ntilde.AgentHost.Contracts.dll open — which made *every* full repo build fail with
# MSB3027/MSB3021 on the McpServer copy step, whether or not the app was running. Point the
# MCP client at the sidecar path this script prints and the repo stays buildable.
#
# The DLL-lock problem this solves is Windows-specific, but the script runs on Linux/macOS too
# (rsync/Copy-Item fallback for mirroring, no .exe suffix) so it's usable as a generic
# always-fresh launcher anywhere.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-sidecar.ps1                 # Debug build, build + mirror + launch
#   scripts/run-sidecar.ps1 -Configuration Release
#   scripts/run-sidecar.ps1 -NoBuild        # skip the build; just mirror current output + launch
#   scripts/run-sidecar.ps1 -SkipMcpServer  # app only; don't build/mirror the MCP server
#   scripts/run-sidecar.ps1 -SidecarRoot /some/path   # override sidecar location
