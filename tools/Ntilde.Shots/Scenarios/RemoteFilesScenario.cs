/// (<c>TerminalPane.IsRemoteFilesSidebarSupported</c>, <c>Controls/TerminalPane.axaml.cs:941-945</c>)
/// requires <c>Profile.Type == ConnectionType.SSH &amp;&amp; Profile.SshBackendKind == SshBackendKind.Native</c>
/// — a genuinely connected native SSH session, not merely a profile of that type. The sidebar's
/// contents come from <c>RemoteFilesSidebarViewModel.OpenAsync</c>, which lists a directory over that
/// live session; there is nothing to list without one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>DemoWorld has no reachable SSH server to connect to.</b> Every scenario's pane runs the demo
/// profile — a local bash shell (<c>DemoWorld.BuildDemoProfile</c>) — and the harness has no local SSH
/// daemon of its own. The product's own SSH E2E tests exist
/// (<c>tests/Ntilde.Platform.Tests/Ssh/DockerSshFixture.cs</c>) but stand up a Docker container,
/// which this harness cannot depend on without contradicting its own design constraints: it is meant
/// to be fast, dependency-free and fully offline (<c>scripts/shots.ps1 all</c> currently runs eleven
/// scenarios in about 75 seconds with nothing beyond git and bash on PATH).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This file still runs <see cref="TerminalPane.ToggleRemoteFilesSidebar"/> for real against the demo
/// (local) profile, which the real code refuses for exactly the reason above, and then waits for
/// <c>RemoteEntriesList</c> to report at least one row before ever calling
/// <see cref="ShotContext.Capture"/> — so if this is ever registered again before the underlying gap
/// is closed, it fails loudly with a timeout instead of quietly publishing an empty sidebar. That is
/// the brief's own instruction ("the scenario must fail rather than capture an empty sidebar") turned
/// into code rather than left as a comment.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What would re-enable it.</b> A way for this offline harness to hand a pane a genuinely connected
/// native SSH session with a small, controlled remote filesystem to browse — for example, an in-process
/// fake transport wired through the same <c>SshBackendKind.Native</c> path the product itself uses,
/// rather than a real network connection. That is a change to the SSH stack under <c>src/</c>, which
/// this task may not touch, and a shortcut version of it (setting <c>IsVisible</c> on a sidebar with no
/// backing session, or wiring a decoder the product does not ship) is exactly the dishonest screenshot
/// this project exists to refuse — see the sixel/iTerm2 scenarios' own header comments for the same
/// call made the same way.
