    // Git for Windows' system vimrc (/etc/vimrc, sourced before any user vimrc — confirmed via
    // `vim --version`'s "system vimrc file" line and by reading it directly) sets a statusline
    // whose last-modified clause is `strftime("%H:%M %d/%m/%Y", getftime(expand("%:p")))` - the
    // seeded file's own mtime, formatted as a live-looking clock. Because DemoWorld re-seeds the
    // workspace (and so rewrites src/sixel-decoder.rs) on every run, that mtime - and therefore
    // this rendered timestamp - differs run to run, exactly like an unpinned wall clock would.
    // DemoWorld.cs's HOME redirect never touches it because it lives in the *system* vimrc, not
    // a user one. Fixed the same way the git dates are pinned: at the point of invocation, not by
    // patching the machine's vimrc. `-c` (not VIMINIT) keeps the override scenario-local - it
    // runs after all of vim's own init, so nothing vimrc does can shadow it, and it touches
    // nothing outside this one process launch. The replacement statusline keeps every clause of
    // the original except the timestamp one: filename, flags, fileformat, then a right-aligned
    // line/column/percent position.
    // macOS ships no system vimrc that turns on syntax highlighting or an always-on status line, so
    // both are asked for here too rather than inherited from the capturing machine.
