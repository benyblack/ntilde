/// The Connection Manager window listing two seeded SSH profiles.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Previously deferred, now unblocked.</b> This scenario was kept out of
/// <see cref="ScenarioCatalog"/> because <c>JsonSshProfileStore</c> resolved its store path from
/// <c>LocalApplicationData</c> directly and ignored <c>NTILDE_APPDATA_ROOT</c>, so running it
/// inside this harness's isolated demo world still read and wrote the machine's real
/// <c>ssh/profiles.json</c>. That was confirmed empirically, not just by reading: seeding these two
/// profiles and running one unrelated scenario was enough for MigrateLegacyProfiles to write a
/// fictional edge-01.demo.internal entry into a real file holding seven genuine saved connections.
/// Had the manager been opened in that run, the screenshot would have shown those seven real
/// hostnames and usernames. The pollution was reverted by hand at the time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both Platform paths now resolve through <c>PlatformAppPaths</c>, which honours the override, so
/// a sandboxed run reads and writes only its own profile store and the two profiles below are the
/// only ones that can appear.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the window is constructed here rather than opened through MainWindow.</b> The manager is
/// now a real top-level window, and <c>MainWindow.OpenConnectionManagerAsync</c> ends in
/// <c>await window.ShowDialog(this)</c>. ShowDialog hangs headlessly - MainWindow's own palette
/// registration comments call that out as the reason its Backup entries are asserted by reflection
/// rather than invoked - so driving <c>ToggleConnections</c> would wedge the capture rather than
/// photograph it. Constructing <see cref="ConnectionManagerWindow"/> and calling <c>Show()</c> is
/// the same route <see cref="SettingsWindowScenario"/> already takes for SettingsWindow.
///
/// The theme is applied the way production applies it, because the picture depends on it. Nothing
/// else production wires up (the saved-password vault, the quick-open and copy-command callbacks)
/// changes a still image, so none of it is reproduced here - this is not a mock of the manager, it
/// is the real control rendering the real seeded profile store.
