/// <para>
/// Does not open <see cref="DemoWorld.DemoProfile"/> like every other scenario. That profile's
/// <c>--norc</c> argument is deliberate everywhere else (see <c>DemoWorld.BuildDemoProfile</c>'s own
/// remarks): bash's <c>no_rc</c> flag suppresses <em>any</em> rc-file sourcing, including a custom one
/// supplied via <c>--rcfile</c>, so <c>BashShellIntegrationProvider</c>'s merged arguments
/// (<c>--rcfile &lt;bootstrap&gt; --noprofile --norc -i</c>) never actually source the bootstrap script
/// - confirmed empirically: three real git commands run against the demo profile produced no
/// <c>history.jsonl</c> at all. This scenario needs the opposite trade, so it opens its own profile
/// (<see cref="BuildCommandAssistProfile"/>) with <c>--norc</c> dropped, letting the bootstrap script
/// run for real.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Dropping only <c>--norc</c> was tried first and was not enough: a captured image showed the real
/// <c>behna@LegoinB</c> prompt, because Git for Windows' <c>/etc/bash.bashrc</c> still ran and
/// overwrote the <c>PS1</c> this world sets as a process environment variable (see
/// <c>DemoWorld.ApplyDemoEnvironment</c>'s own remarks - this is exactly the leak <c>--norc</c>
/// exists to prevent everywhere else). <c>DemoWorld.WriteHomeBashrc</c> fixes this: the bootstrap
/// script sources <c>~/.bashrc</c> before doing anything else and only <em>appends</em> its OSC 133
/// mark to whatever <c>PS1</c> it finds there rather than overwriting it, so a <c>~/.bashrc</c> that
/// reassigns <c>PS1</c> back to the demo prompt restores it one step after <c>/etc/bash.bashrc</c>
/// clobbered it, and the mark still lands on the corrected value. Confirmed by looking at the actual
/// captured image, not merely asserted here.
