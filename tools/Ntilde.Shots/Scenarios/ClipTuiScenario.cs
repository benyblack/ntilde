/// demo-monitor.sh's own header explains why it exists: htop, btop and top are all missing on the
/// capture machine, so this is a fabricated, literal-printf stand-in rather than a real process
/// monitor. Its three redraws are gated behind <see cref="ClipAgentScenario.PacedEnvironmentVariable"/>
/// - the same variable name <c>ClipAgentScenario</c> sets for demo-test.sh, reused here rather than
/// invented twice - and, with it set, are spaced ~300ms apart in real time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Each of the three redraws prints the byte-for-byte identical screen (same fixed PIDs, same
/// fixed percentages - see demo-monitor.sh's <c>draw_frame</c>) - proving the mechanism (clear,
/// then redraw) rather than showing changing data, the same scoping its header comment states.
/// So the visible motion this clip actually has is the launch itself - the shell prompt giving way
/// to the full-screen table - not new information appearing redraw over redraw. This scenario
/// does not manufacture fake motion to compensate: <see cref="RunAsync"/>'s own report of its
/// distinct-frame ratio names this plainly rather than padding the clip with holds that would not
