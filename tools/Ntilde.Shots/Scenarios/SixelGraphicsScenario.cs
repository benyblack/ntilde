/// An image decoded and rendered inline in the terminal via sixel.

/// <remarks>

/// <b>Formerly deferred; both blockers are now fixed.</b> This scenario spent a long time
/// implemented but unregistered, for two separate reasons in sequence.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// First, nothing under <c>src/</c> assigned <see cref="Ntilde.VT.AnsiParser.ImageDecoder"/>,
/// so the parser consumed the escape sequence correctly and then dropped the picture - a plain
/// build rendered nothing. An earlier version of this harness papered over that by injecting its
/// own decoder, which made the screenshot advertise a capability no shipped build had; that
/// injection was removed rather than kept. Production now wires a real decoder
/// (<c>TerminalPane.CreateAndWireParser</c> assigns <c>SkiaImageDecoder</c>), so the picture here
/// is decoded by the same code a user runs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Second, the cursor was not returned to column 0 once an image was placed, so the shell prompt
/// after it resumed mid-row - an indent for sixel, and for the narrower iTerm2 logo an overrun
/// past the last column that wrapped the prompt mid-word. That is fixed too (#405), along with the
/// follow-on where the post-image newline swallow leaked past other output and ate a later line
/// break.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="InlineImageDecoding"/> asserts both properties on every run - a genuinely decoded
/// region, and text resuming at column 0 - so neither blocker can return unnoticed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The OSC 1339 tunnel the committed asset uses is unrelated to either fix and still matters: on
/// Windows a raw <c>ESC P ... q ... ST</c> DCS sixel sent through ConPTY never reaches AnsiParser
/// at all, which docs/IMAGE_PROTOCOL_SUPPORT.md documents for this platform. The image bytes and
/// the decoder invoked on them are identical either way; only the transport envelope differs.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
