# A fabricated `top`-style snapshot, not the real thing. `ps aux` (what this replaced) prints
# every byte from the real OS process table - the capture machine's real uid/gid, its real TTY
# names, real PIDs, and this very harness's own bash/grep/head processes - which DemoWorld's PS1
# and environment overrides cannot touch, because none of that text passes through them. This
# script is plain printf: nothing it prints came from the real machine, so there is nothing here
# for the demo environment to fail to mask.
#
# Row count (22 lines: 2 header + 20 process rows) is fixed and chosen to fill hero-split's
# bottom-right pane close to its bottom edge without overflowing it. Tuned against the actual
# captured image, not the raw PTY row count: the pane's own row count reported at spawn time
# (~26-27) left no room for the command's own echoed line once a 22-process table (24 content
# rows) was tried - the echo scrolled off the top, the exact failure this task calls worse than a
# small gap. 20 process rows leaves a one-row margin. See HeroSplitScenario's remarks for the
# full row budget this was tuned against. Extended from an original 9-row table (round 1) because
# 9 rows left the pane roughly half blank, which is what this task's Job 1 fix addresses.
